<h3><strong>DSA-Sec Exercise 2022</strong></h3>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students for admission outside of the centralized posting system, via their own selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student&rsquo;s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools&rsquo; academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities related to the talent which they are selected for Year 1 - 4.</p>
<p><br /><strong><u>Talent Areas</u></strong><br>At Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School, we aim to nurture our students into young ladies and gentlemen with the courage to lead and serve through a wide range of school experiences.<br>In line with our school&rsquo;s focus on the holistic development of our students and to nurture the diversified talent areas, we are looking for students who&nbsp;</p>
a)&nbsp;have a keen interest in understanding societal issues and in harnessing the media to generate an awareness of these issues and advocate for change, to make a difference in the lives of others, or<br>
b) have keen interest, disposition and ability in music (EMP), or<br>
c) have good level of sports skills in Shooting and Track &amp; Field; or<br>
d) possess positive attitude, good communication skills and have demonstrated leadership capabilities.
