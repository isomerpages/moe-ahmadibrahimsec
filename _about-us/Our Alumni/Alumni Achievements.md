<p>Congratulations to Sakthibalan Balathandautham from Class of 2009, for
being awarded the Straits Times Singaporean of the Year 2021. His strong
advocacy of organ donation is exemplified by no less than his own act of
donating a part of his liver to a baby in need. AI is proud of you!</p>

<p>Channel NewsAsia featured national shooter Jasmine Ser and traced the
history of the shooting sport at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS).
Ser shared that AISS had a long track record of achievements, leading to
an inevitable pressure on the student athletes to continue the school’s
legacy.</p>
<p>Mr Charles Cheak, Subject head of CCA/AISS, said there was a talent identification
programme for all Secondary 1 students and they go through suitability
assessments, where they get to try out all sports in order to determine
their suitability for each of them.</p>
<p>Mr Yao Zi Jian, Assistant Year Head of Secondary 2/AISS, added that there
was a Shooting Appreciation Module during physical education lessons where
students could learn more about, and thus gain a deeper appreciation of,
the sport.</p>

<h4><strong>Alumni featured in Malay Newspaper</strong></h4>
<p>Two of our alumni were featured in the local Malay newspaper recently.
I believe teachers, especially those who have taught them before will be
happy to note how they have since progress on.</p>
<p>The first alumnus is Nuraziana Mohamed Said. She was featured in the Berita
Minggu newspaper last Saturday. Nuraziana was our VI student. From AI she
went on to ITE to do accountancy and is now in her final year in UNISIM
pursuing her degree in Malay Language and Literature. Definitely a story
of resilience – one that could motivate our current students to charge
on and succeed in life regardless of the challenges they are facing.</p>
<p>In another article a few weeks back, another alumnus, Ms Shakila Jamal
Mohamed was featured for being one of the recipient of the President’s
Award for Teachers 2013. In her interview, she attributed her success partly
to a Mrs David, her former teacher at AI.</p>
<p>Mrs David, according to Shakila, was responsible for turning her from
a quiet and passive student into a more confident person (and of course,
a successful educator).</p>
