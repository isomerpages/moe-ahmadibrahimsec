<p>AI has nurtured many generations of alumni over 60 years of rich history.
We have a healthy number of alumni who return as teachers and those whose
children also study in AI.
<br>
<br>Our AI alumni are established in respective fields and provide a broad
network with which to enhance our AI studentsâ€™ learning experience. AI
alumni provide strong support in key areas such as co-curricular activities
(CCAs) and Education Career Guidance by conducting Career and Industry
talks as well as motivational talks to our students.
<br>
<br>We are proud of our alumni, and we celebrate their achievements through
our school website and our Social Media.
<br>
<br>We encourage our alumni to be actively involved and to be contributing
role models, so as to meaningfully enhance school life for our AI students.
