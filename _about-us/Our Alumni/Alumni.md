<p>AI has nurtured many generations of alumni over 60 years of rich history. We have a healthy number of alumni who return as teachers and those whose children also study in AI.<br>
	
Our AI alumni are established in respective fields and provide a broad network with which to enhance our AI studentsâ€™ learning experience.  AI alumni provide strong support in key areas such as co-curricular activities (CCAs) and Education Career Guidance by conducting Career and Industry talks as well as motivational talks to our students.<br>

We are proud of our alumni, and we celebrate their achievements through our school website and our Social Media.<br>
	
We encourage our alumni to be actively involved and to be contributing role models, so as to meaningfully enhance school life for our AI students.
