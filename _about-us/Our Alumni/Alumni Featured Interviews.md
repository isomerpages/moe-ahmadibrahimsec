</p>
<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>Secondary
3 OLE program to Gunung Ayam (I hope i have the correct hill). During my
time - OLE3 was allocated to my batch by CCA types (ie Performing Arts
/ Sports / UG etc). This I believe was done to ensure the skill sets required
/ tasked were matching our learning curve.
<br>
</p>
<p>I was with the AISS Warrior Scouts during this time - and we took a train
into Malaysia and began our trip from the train station. My memories of
hiking up the steep hill, heavy backpack with gears, covered in mud - playing
in river rapids and even exploring limestone caves in the area; are still
etched in my memories. Our campsite and water source - situated on the
edge of a waterfall - was also our bathing area - amazing views and photos
were taken here - and not to forget the piercing pitch darkness that the
night. I still can recall the leeches that some of us were bitten by and
even managed to "join" us on the train back to Singapore.
<br>
</p>
<p>All in all - it made to want to explore and travel the world beyond what
we simply see.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?<br></strong>My
secondary 1 &amp; 2 life was honestly terrible. I would consider myself
to be a little less interested in studying during that phase – but during
my upper secondary studies - I got my gears into place topping the level
for combined sciences and Ace-ing other subjects too.
<br>
</p>
<p>The ultimate takeaway : anything can be achieved, if you set your heart
and mind into it. This is the kind of person that I have become today.</p>

<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Staying back after school hours to engage in a variety of extracurricular
activities alongside friends, including basketball and interactive computer
games.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I crossed paths with a multitude of motivating educators who urged me
to pursue personal development, placing strong emphasis on attributes like
compassion, discipline, and empathy. Notably, individuals like Mr. Gabriel
Morais, my form teacher in 4E1 in 2001, and Ms. Emily Tow, my biology teacher,
were instrumental in recognizing and reinforcing my potential.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I embarked on my academic journey by earning a Bachelor's degree in Chemical
and Biomolecular Engineering at NTU, and later, a Doctorate in Bioengineering
from Imperial College London. Throughout my studies, I maintained a stellar
academic record, graduating with first-class honors and earning recognition
as a Dean's list recipient. During my PhD research, I made significant
contributions to the field of synthetic biology. Notably, I pioneered the
groundbreaking concept of designer probiotics for human health, becoming
the first in the world to do so. This innovative work was published in
Molecular Systems Biology in 2011, a prestigious scientific journal in
the field. It not only earned the distinction of being the best research
paper in that journal but also ranked among the Top 10 Singapore Research
papers of the same year.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2014, I took on a pivotal role as the inaugural Program Manager of
the NUS Synthetic Biology Research Program. In this position, I collaborated
with private companies and government agencies to harness the economic
potential of synthetic biology in Singapore, contributing to its growth
and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2017, I joined the Singapore Institute of Technology as a lecturer
and, over the years, progressed to the position of Associate Professor
in 2023. This transition allowed me to continue my passion for education
and research. I am deeply grateful for the financial support I have received
from various esteemed organizations, such as the Ministry of Education,
Ministry of Defence, and the Lee Foundation. In 2022, I was honored to
receive the Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent award, which
recognized my dedication to scientific excellence and my contributions
to the betterment of society and human lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps the proudest moments in my career have come as a mentor, witnessing
the joy and fulfillment on the faces of my students as they realize their
dreams and achieve their goals. These moments reaffirm the significance
of my work in education and research, inspiring the next generation of
scientists and innovators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down your career path?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>An inquisitive spirit, a love for science, and a compassionate heart for
humanity.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for our students of today?</strong>
</p>
<p>Maintain patience and unwavering commitment in your pursuit of dreams;
the rewards will arrive at the right moment!</p>

</div>
<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was wonderful how the programs and structure of AI brought out the
kampung atmosphere of 'gotong royong' where students from various levels
and classes worked together in making each milestone a success in itself.
My fondest memory must be the time I spent in my CCAs and the time I spent
representing AI for the interschool Debate Competition (Malay Language)
in 1988. AI was the National Champion the previous year and the pressure
for us to win was huge! We only had 1 week to prepare for the next qualifying
round and it was hectic. There were a lot of other students who were helping
us in the background, doing research, preparing props and being the alternate
team for us to practice. Our seniors came back to help us in our trainings.
The teacher in charge, Cikgu Rahmah Abdullah, was instrumental in bringing
the team and all the other students together as we were from different
classes, and she pushed us all to shine. We won the National competition
and brought back the trophy. It was such a pleasant memory with the deafening
cheers from busloads of supporters.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>AI was a place that provided a safe space for students to explore their
ideas and interests. No matter what our level of ability was, once we showed
interest, the Teachers and Seniors would coach us so that we could improve
our skills and abilities. We were always encouraged to take the initiative
to plan and organize activities. I believe this helped us to always 'think
out of the box' and this has helped me in my working life as I have to
deal with many challenges of running my agency and needed to find various
unconventional ways to resolve them. AI has such a good pool of teachers
who were always supportive. I remember there was a time when my friends
and I were staying back after school and we were stuck on a Math problem.
A random Math teacher was passing by and we ran up to him to ask for help.
He sportingly taught us the Math concepts in the middle of the canteen.
The approachable nature of the teachers helped create the environment that
was conducive for students to reach out and be resourceful. This in turn
helped me have a 'can-do' attitude where I will explore ways to achieve
what I want.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>After AI, I went to Raffles Junior College. This was a pleasant achievement
as I was not among the top students in my class and neither was I from
the top few classes in my level. I went on to do my degree in NUS, Masters
in Economics in IIUM and another Masters in Counselling in UniSA. I am
currently heading APKIM Resources, an agency that provides counselling,
adoption services and programs for couples and families. I still take up
a few clients for marital counseling but I mainly do adoption counseling,
for birth families considering to give up their child for adoption.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down your career path?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since I was a student, I have always been involved in planning and running
programs. I love providing services where I can be directly involved with
the people I serve. Hence, when I was given an opportunity to lead APKIM,
I did not hesitate and left my job at a Statutory Board. I enjoy being
a part of the team that gives our clients a safe space where their voices
are heard, they are able to work on their issues and where relationships
and families are formed in adoption works. Couples attending our marriage
preparation or enrichment programs gain significant insights and are more
aware of relevant issues. I continue to be enriched as I perform my job
and I am grateful to be privileged to learn directly from the diverse life
experiences of APKIM's clients.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for our students of today?</strong>
</p>
<p>Give your 100% focus in whatever you do and do not be afraid to reach
out for help. The resources are available for you to use wisely so do grab
the opportunities. After you have given your best, be proud of yourself
because the effort is what matters most. Last but not least, be kind and
supportive to one another and have lots &amp; lots of fun!</p>

<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Spending time in making some of the best friends in life that I kept till
today.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was slightly slower in terms of learning, perhaps due to my short attention
span, and my playful nature during my younger days proved to be challenging.
I am thankful for the slower pace of learning in the Normal Academic Stream
and having nurturing teachers and great friends alongside me to tide me
through my budding years.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am currently working as a physiotherapist in Changi General Hospital
for 2 years - I was awarded the Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy, Honours
with Merit from SiT-TCD - I was also the recipient of the MOHH Healthcare
Merit Award for Physiotherapy from 2017-2021 - I also represent Singapore
in Olympic Wrestling as the current National Team Captain - I have been
to the SEA Games 3x, Commonwealth Games 1x - 2x Bronze medalist at the
2019 and 2023 SEA Games.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down your career path?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As an athlete, I had a few injuries, some minor, some requiring surgeries.
My physiotherapist played a major in my rehabilitation journey. They helped
me to return to my sport, competitively at a national and regional level.
I wish to pay it forward and help other athletes who are facing what I
faced, helping them to get back on their feet. (This was my original intent)
However, having worked in the field for 2 years, I enjoy helping everyday
people from young adults to the elderly to get back to doing what is important
to them, adding life to years.</p>

<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My time as an alto saxophonist in AISS military band / symphonic band
in 2002-2005, where we did drills, marching, sectionals, music practice
every alternate day, and various other bonding activities. As well as playing
leisure basketball in school after lessons every other day (when there
was no band activities) until the evening when the school compound is closing
and the Indian security guard will holler "deng chu liao!" to us (Hokkien
for "time to go home!", but he said it in an endearing manner), and thereafter,
often moving over to Chong Pang CC or Block 111 to continue playing basketball
until past dinner time. Forged many fond memories and best friends during
these times.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Band instilled in me discipline, focus, the collective team spirit, and
we-can-do-it attitude. Basketball reminded me to always have fun and hang
out with friends despite the tough rigours of school and CCA. Being in
a neighbourhood school where it was truly a melting pot of races, backgrounds
and life experiences, has taught me to be grounded, the human touch in
interpersonal relationships, and different perspectives in life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I went on to Anderson Junior College, then NUS Law School. Now practising
as a dispute lawyer with Harry Elias Partnership LLP: <a href="https://www.harryelias.com/of-counsel/kok-yee-keong" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.harryelias.com/of-counsel/kok-yee-keong</a> Also
a Legal Skills Instructor with NUS Law School: <a href="https://law.nus.edu.sg/people/yee-keong-kok/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://law.nus.edu.sg/people/yee-keong-kok/</a> During
my time in National Service, I started grassroots volunteering with Chong
Pang CC (where I used to hang out very often after school and thus formed
a connection of sorts).&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some achievements include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1) Teaching the Legal Analysis, Research and Communication (LARC) module
to a class of 10 to 13 first-year students, twice a week, over 2 semesters,
at NUS Law School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Named as one of Singapore’s 18 most influential lawyers under 40 by
the Singapore Business Review in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(3) Served as a young amicus curiae (friend of court) in a High Court
case on novel issues of law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) Best Feature Article by a Young Lawyer 2021, Law Gazette, Law Society
of Singapore&nbsp;</p>
<p>(5) Volunteering on various legal committees, such as the Personal Injury
/ Property Damage (PIPD) Committee, and the Community Legal Clinics (CLC)
Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(6) Volunteering at various legal clinics and Criminal Legal Aid Scheme
(CLAS).&nbsp;</p>
<p>(7) Appeared in all levels of Court on diverse subject matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(8) Grassroots Leader with Chong Pang CC for over 14 years, and on its
CCMC and CPYN.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down your career path?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I was choosing a university course, I sought an occupation that satisfied
2 criteria: (1) ability to help people directly, and (2) opportunity to
meet people on almost daily basis. Surprisingly, I did well at 'A' levels.
The old-school mindset of "don't waste good grades" kicked-in, and therefore,
I applied for medicine school first, and law school second, with NUS. I
was rejected by medicine school, and ended up in law school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for our students of today?</strong>
</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoy your schooling days, and make lasting friends! It is
one of the last opportunities in your lifetime to organically befriend
people, and to do 'silly' things with them which later become cherished
memories. When you grow older and enter the workforce, you will look back
and either recall these fond memories, or regret that you haven't done
(enough of) this or that. I wish the former upon you!</p>

<p><strong>What is your fondest memory of life in AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were so many fond memories, like singing together with my classmates
during music lessons in Sec 1 and 2, and having my sketch titled The Modern
Little Red Riding Hood selected and performed on stage during assembly
with my classmates, as well as the move from Upper Thomson Road to the
current Yishun location when I was in Sec 2. They were all memorable, not
just for the events themselves, but because of the dedicated teachers and
wonderful, fun and helpful classmates who were also involved! If I must
choose the fondest memory, then it would be that of participating in the
Inter-School Chemistry Speech Contest (now known as Chemistry•Communication
Challenge, or “Chem-dot-Comm” organised by the Chemistry Department, National
University of Singapore or NUS) when I was in Sec 4 with three other classmates.
Our Chemistry teacher Ms Pauline Wee was very encouraging and tirelessly
trained us in researching the topic, selecting the essential materials
and presenting orally before going for the competition. We practised in
class and some classmates also offered helpful suggestions, and even assisted
us prepare the slides. And the best of all was having the whole class supporting
us at the NUS competition. We didn’t win any award, but the spirit of the
whole class and the support given by teachers and the school really left
a deep impression on me.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How has AI shaped you into the person you are today?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>AI’s all-rounded approach encouraged me to be open-minded and to develop
my interests and explore new subjects and skills. Even though I majored
in the Sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), I was given the opportunity
to study the humanities. I took literature and enjoyed it so much! It had
helped me in my analytical and writing skills. I also recalled my Sec 2
form teacher Mrs Lim Chin Tok who was also the art teacher asking me to
consider taking up art at higher level. Sadly, I had to decline as I had
already selected 9 subjects for my “O” Levels and I was afraid I couldn’t
cope. The school also encouraged us to learn alongside the visually-challenged
students and to show empathy and tolerance to all around us. The “care”
element is thus crucial in training me to be more patient and considerate,
and this has helped me in my work now—be it creating my own work, working
with collaborators, teaching art students or dealing with clients.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>After AI, I moved on to the then Anderson Junior College to study my ‘A’
levels, majoring in the sciences—Biology and Chemistry. I was able to get
the grades that allowed me to enrol in pharmacy at NUS. I managed to obtain
a degree after 3 years and undergo a one-year pre-registration training
before getting my licence as a pharmacist. After working for about 2 years,
I felt that I needed to pursue something that I had always loved—art—because
I couldn’t get any younger. So, at age 26, I went to study at LASALLE College
of the Arts. The first art prize I won after my diploma proved that I might
be able to pursue art as a career path, even though I knew it would be
challenging. After obtaining my Bachelor of Arts (Fine Art), I gave up
my pharmacy licence and practised art full-time. That was the greatest
change in my life! Then between 2013–17, I became a student again and completed
my third degree—Bachelor of Arts (Translation &amp; Interpretation)—in
2018. I think the proudest moment of my artistic career was winning the
Young Artist Award (Art) given by the National Arts Council in 2004 and
receiving the award at the Istana, witnessed by my parents. Being in the
2nd Singapore Biennale where I created a large-scale drawing installation
that spanned over 4 inter-connected rooms was also memorable for me, not
just because it was an important international art exhibition based in
Singapore, but also giving me the opportunity to create a site-specific
new work that showed the progress of my practice. Another important achievement
would be the completion of the commissioned work Walking into the Interstitial
by the Land Transport Authority at Marina Bay Station, Thomson-East Coast
Line in November 2022.</p>

</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down your career path?</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interestingly, I didn’t stay long in pharmacy—my first career path. I
do have strong interests in biology and chemistry, inspired by the excellent
teachers I had at Sec. 3 and 4. Their delivery was very clear and the lessons
in the laboratory were lively and systematic. I had initially chosen to
further my studies in pharmacy because I thought it was a field that required
both Biology and Chemistry, and it would be interesting to know how medicines
work and to help humankind in the treatment of diseases. But after two
years as a pharmacist, I realised something was lacking and that I still
love art. A friend falling sick and a song titled Dreams by my Taiwanese
singer idol made me reflect on life’s ephemerality. I was then inspired
to study art at LASALLE College of the Arts. Winning the Della Butcher
Art Award after my diploma also marked a milestone in my artistic path.
I went on to complete my Bachelor of Arts (Fine Art) and presented my first
solo exhibition a year after graduation in 2002.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for our students of today?</strong>
</p>
<p>Be open-minded and strive to learn as much things in life as you can.
You may be passionate about one thing, but explore others as well to be
aware of what is going on in other aspects of life, in this world. You
may never know when you may need that knowledge or skills, e.g. learn to
cook your own meals or even cut one’s hair! Once you have selected a path,
stay focused and honest, work hard to get to your destination. Hear from
different perspectives and examine all possibilities. Take the risks instead
of overthinking. Learn to let go and be happy with what you have. You may
not be able to get all you want, but so long as you know you have tried
your best, give yourself a pat on the back! Show empathy and be considerate
to people around you.</p>

<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>I have great memories
from my AI days. Learning was always fun with my teachers and classmates.
We are still very good friends after so many years.</p>
<p>I was from the Military band. It must have been the most memorable times
in AI. We had over 100 new recruits the year i joined and we had a lot
of fun learning how to play the instruments and practicing for all the
marching parade and performances. I was appointed Band Major in 1990 and
had the chance to lead the band. This experience helped me grew a lot and

<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>I remember my time
in AI as experiencing the freedom of being supported and guided by good
teachers and friends, and yet not be burdened by undue expectations or
unrealistic goals. That gave me the confidence, and support, to find my
life directions and priorities. Teachers and friends in AI were sincere
and authentic, and it was easy to make and keep friends. In fact, I’m still
in touch with a few classmates, and we play soccer occasionally. We run
less, at a slower pace, but we still chat as much whilst we’re playing!
AI provided the environment for lifelong friendships.</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word<br></strong>A few come to mind:</p>
<p>(a) Freedom – You chose your pace, your goals, your level of ambition.
And the teachers would match that with corresponding support, and ambition!
Not that they would permit any of us to be mediocre or slack, but they
gave us lots of room to grow and mature.</p>
<p>(b) Sincerity – There was such a refreshing lack of airs and pretensions.
People were comfortable being who they were, and who/how others were. There
was an authenticity from the teachers, which encouraged us to be genuinely
supportive of our peers.</p>
<p>(c) Selflessness – many teachers were extremely hardworking and giving.
Whilst we strived and worked hard, were never became overly competitive
nor selfish. There was always celebration for the achievement(s) and successes
of our classmates. Even as I meet my AI classmates today, there is not
a single hint of envy amongst us despite the differences in our vocation
and material wealth - we’re just glad to be together again.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>I went on to Catholic Junior
College, and then read Law at the National University of Singapore. My
first jobs were in Law – as a legal officer and then as a law lecturer.
Then, I switched to teaching at a university, which I’m still doing after
more than a decade. Needless to say, the exemplary teachers I encountered
at AI inspired me (thanks Mr Kumar!), and I’m just trying to pass on the
values and live out the attributes I witnessed for myself in AI.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>See
above.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>(a) Build lasting
friendships – you’ll want friends to still play with in your fifties!
<br>(b) Learn from the best teachers – they exemplify the kind of life, vocation,
and calling we all aspire to.
<br>(c) Freedom is good only if there is also Friendship + Family – to support
you through thick and thin in life, and desire the best for you. If you
look hard enough, you can find it in your school!</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>My participation
in our school’s theatre production, “The King and I”. I was fortunate to
have been given the opportunity to play the role of Prince Chulalongkorn
in the musical in 1998 when I was in Sec 3. The time I spent with the cast
&amp; crew, the relationships I built and the experiences that I had form
some of my fondest memories of life in AI.</p>
<p>In addition, I had the privilege of representing AI in the first Julia
Gabriel Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships in 1999 together
with my talented teammates. I also met my wife Meera in AI, where we both
worked together as emcees for the school’s Speech &amp; Prize Giving Day
in 1999. These too are other fond memories of mine of life in AI.</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word.<br></strong>“Defining” – I say this because
I gained experiences in AI that defined my future path. My tertiary education,
my career and my personal life were all positively influenced by my life
in AI. Dedicated teachers, endearing friendships and enriching learning
experiences at AI helped me prepare for future challenges. I am who I am
today largely because of this defining phase of my life at AI.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>After completing my GCE
‘O’ Level examinations, I went to Anderson Junior College to pursue my
pre-university education. Again, thanks to great teachers and a conducive
learning environment at AJC, I managed to perform well in my GCE ‘A’ Level
examinations. I also had the opportunity to excel in Drama in AJC, through
my CCA, the English LDDS. After National Service, I pursued Medicine in
the National University of Singapore (NUS) and graduated with M.B,B.S.
During my years in medical school, I continued to pursue my interest in
drama by participating in stage plays and working as an actor/host in various
television shows on Vasantham Channel between 2003 and 2007.</p>
<p>Upon graduation, I served my bond as a medical officer with the Ministry
Of Health by working in various hospitals and departments, learning important
skills and gaining valuable experiences that helped me become a better
doctor. I then moved to the private sector and served as the resident anchor
doctor of Silver Cross Family Clinic (Yishun) for more than 4 years. During
this period, I completed my Graduate Diploma in Family Medicine, became
a registered Family Physician and also passed the United States Medical
Licensing Examinations.</p>
<p>In October 2017, I started my own clinic, Day and Night Family Clinic,
at Sembawang. My goal is to provide holistic care to patients and improve
the quality of Family Medicine services in Singapore. In addition to being
busy with work at my clinic which opens every day of the week, I spend
valuable time with my wife, Meera and my lovely daughter, Diya, who turns
5 this year. I also occasionally engage in photography as a hobby during
my free time.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>I come
from a family of engineers. Fortunately, I was never pressured by my parents
to become one. However, they did value the importance of higher education,
always encouraging and motivating me to do better. Although I had initially
wanted to learn film-making in America, my financial situation could not
support this interest. As such, I decided to pursue an education in a field
that would allow me to engage with people and also be able to help them
through creative and analytical thinking. True to these aspirations, I
pursued Medicine and now having been a doctor for a decade, I have had
no regrets. Even though my medical school years were the most trying period
of my life, I persevered. I was inspired to pursue Family Medicine, thanks
to the positive experiences I had during my related clinical postings during
these years.</p>
<p>Some quotes that have inspired me:
<br>“It is not the destination that matters, but the journey instead” - Anonymous
<br>“Humility is the greatest wisdom” - My university tutor, Prof. Kuldip
Singh
<br>“Stay hungry, stay foolish” - Steve Jobs, Apple Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>a) Love and
respect your parents as they will always mean the best for you.
<br>b) Respect and value your teachers as their greatest joy is seeing you
grow.
<br>c) Don’t engage in activities like smoking, drinking and abusing drugs,
as these do nothing but harm you.
<br>d) Work and play equally hard so that life can not only be successful,
but also fulfilling.</p>

<p><strong>Describe AI in one word<br></strong>“Forever”! The memories and
friendship forged will always stay close to my heart. There are so many
memories which are always close to my heart such as patient and caring
teachers who spent extra hours to help me with my learning (e.g., Chemistry
F9 in the school Prelim exams, but a C5 at the O-level exams), and of course
friends whom I still keep in touch with!</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>After I graduated, I went
on to Temasek Polytechnic to do a Diploma in Electronics, where I also
received the CapitaLand Award for All-Round Excellence in 2011. Upon graduation
from TP, I enlisted for BMT and joined the Air Force, where I got the SAF
Academic Scholarship (Military) in 2012, and was sponsored to train at
the renowned Military Academy in the Australian Defence Force Academy.
I then did a Bachelor Degree in Aeronautical Engineering (University of
New South Wales (Canberra) @ Australian Defence Force Academy), and am
currently an Air Warfare Officer (Command, Control and Communication) with
the Air Force.</p>
<p>In my “co-curricular activity” of football, I have:
<br>- Represented Home United U15 Team (Y2006; 15 years old - Sec 3)
<br>- Represented Singapore U16 Team (Y2007; 16 years old - Sec 4)
<br>- Represented Singapore U17 and U21 Team (Y2008; 17 Years old)
<br>- Represented Singapore U18 Team (Y2009; 18 Years old)
<br>- Represented Singapore U23 aka Singapore Young Lions (Y2009 - 2011)
<br>- Represented Singapore U23 in 2010 Eximbank Cup held in Vietnam (Sept

<br>- Captained the Temasek Polytechnic Team and emerged as Champion in the
The Institute-Varsity-Polytechnic Games (IVP Games) aka S R Nathan Challenge
Trophy Soccer Tournament in 2011</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>Sports,
in particular Soccer, has always been an important part of my life since
I was 10 years old. It has taught me a lot about discipline, perseverance,
how to stay focused and the importance of being a team player. In fact,
I strongly encourage everyone to have a CCA as I believe that CCAs shape
one’s character.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I have no idea what I wanted career-wise when I was
in secondary school. All I knew was that I enjoyed Soccer a lot so I spent
a lot of time and energy training myself.</p>
<p>Eventually I wanted to play in the S-League and I was fortunate enough
to be talent scouted and selected to play for the Young Lions at the age
of 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of Secondary 4, I wanted to pursue something aviation related
and hence I chose a course related to aviation in polytechnic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I managed to join the Air Force and embark on my career and interest.
As an Air Warfare Officer (Command, Control and Communication) with the
Air Force, I am involved in performing precise air traffic control and
safeguarding our airspace through round-the- clock air surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>Life is full
of challenges and struggles and what defines you is the way you respond
to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Event + Response = Outcome</p>
<p>There were many times I faced failures, such as failures in exams, not
being selected for important Soccer games/tournament, etc. But it is how
you respond to these events that defines you as a person and the outcome.
With hard work, you can achieve what you set out to do. Like they say,
shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you will land among the stars!</p>

<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>Being the first
Performing Arts CCA in AI to be awarded Gold in SYF for the Chinese Orchestra
in 2009. It was a collective pride that we have broken records and fostered
a sense of cohesion that is very valuable. Despite all the hectic practices
up to easily 5-6 times a week when nearing SYF, it was a good run and an
awesome memory that we remember even after graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word.<br></strong>Motivation. Not in a literal
sense and in fact largely indirect. Being in a neighbourhood school, I
knew we were not as resource-rich as compared to that of other top schools.
This made me constantly think about how to do things differently. In this
aspect, I think motivation fits my experiences at AI and ground my life
approaches motivated by thinking about problems and solution in a unique
manner in research.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>Contrary to what most people
think about my experiences, I am not an all-out straight A’s student. I
actually got admitted into National Junior College via Chinese Orchestra
(CO) through the Direct School Admission (DSA). In fact, I believe I got
10 points in O-levels in the end and that puts me easily at the bottom
end of NJC’s cohort.</p>
<p>While I was keen in CO back then and became the President of NJC’s Chinese
Orchestra and Guzheng Ensemble, I knew constantly that research was something
I have always been passionate about. Prior to entering NJC, I applied to
the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) Institute of Bioengineering
and Nanotechnology (IBN) and got into their prestigious Young Research
Program.</p>
<p>When I did start school at NJC, I met back then HOD of Research, Mr. Nick
Chan to request to take H3 Research as a subject because I did not meet
the “standard” O level science scores needed. Upon confirming my attachment
with IBN, he agreed to allow me to take H3 Research and he remained as
my Mentor ever since. Via research, I was also part of NJC’s Sapphire Scholar’s
Program and began representing NJC at the Singapore International Science
Challenge, Singapore Science and Engineering Fair and etc. This was quite
incredible to me as I actually DSA into NJC via Chinese Orchestra and yet,
I had the opportunity to be part of programs reserved for the top O-level
students.</p>
<p>By the end of JC 2, prior to A levels, I applied and was awarded the National
Science Scholarship (BS-PhD) under A*STAR and began studying Chemistry
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I worked with one
of the highest cited chemist in the world, Professor Yi Lu on metal ion
sensing in cells. Eventually, I graduated with Highest Distinction in Chemistry
along with the James Scholar Honors. I am now working collaboratively with
my colleagues at A*STAR, NUS and NTU on photoacoustic imaging for biomedical
applications. Moving on, I will be doing my PhD back in the US with offers
from Stanford University and University of Chicago. It has been a ride
and I never thought I could have gone from an average student in AISS to
where I am now. I hope AI students will carve out their own unique paths
to make an impact on society.</p>

is a particularly hard question and there is no one right answer. I would
say that every aspect of my life led me somehow to this career path in
science. I came from a fairly regular family. My dad is a Consultant while
my mum is an Insurance Agent. While they did not enforce certain ideals
as parents, the one message that came out strong was to be happy with what
I love. I remembered my mum saying that it would take all of her savings
to send me and my twin brother to university. That started me thinking
about how I was going to proceed in my education to change that. At NJC,
Mr. Nick Chan had arguably been the biggest impact in pushing me down the
path of science. I am glad that through the constant ups and downs (mostly
downs) in research, I fell in love with uncertainty and the unpredictability
of science. Through this uncertainty lies a plethora of new discoveries
waiting to be uncovered. In the future, I hope to look back at my life
and tell myself that my choice in science has been a good ride and I have
solved a few important problems that were worth solving.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>Think of and
do something that will differentiate you from the rest. Think big about
how to have an impact on others.</p>

<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>I often got labelled
as “teacher's pet”! My POA teacher, the late Mr Vale, trusted me to be
the class representative for his subject for 3 good years. Not only that,
he loved using my book to go through the homework with the class. My physics
teacher did almost the same. He would send my books or files for the annual
HOD file check. Although I got teased by my classmates, that was definitely
my fondest memory. In fact, most of the teachers who taught me still remember
my name!</p>
<p>I'm also thankful for my commitment in Girl Guides that gave me the opportunity
to lead as an Assistant Company Leader. I'm grateful for receiving awards
such as: SINGA, EAGLES, and the Achievement Day CCA Award for Service.
I also got academic bursaries and scholarships during my first four years
in AI.</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word<br></strong>GREEN!</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>I had my first work experience
at McDonald's while waiting for my O-level results. Although it was just
a short period of time, I enjoyed making ice creams. Since I was working
at Northpoint, some of my customers were my teachers and friends.</p>
<p>I took up a nursing diploma in Ngee Ann Polytechnic where I had so much
fun in school. After that, I started working in Tan Tock Seng Hospital
in a medical ward. Two years ago, I earn my Bachelor's Degree from Curtin
Singapore while juggling studies and work. Today, I have worked for almost
7 years and am a Senior Staff Nurse. On a daily basis, I take charge of
7-8 patients during my shift. At the same time, I'm tasked and given the
responsibility to guide and oversee junior nurses. I have always wanted
to be a teacher but I realised that a nurse plays a teacher’s role too.
Every day in nursing is different, it's a learning process.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>Honestly,
nursing is not easy. Besides passion, it takes a lot of patience. Most
of my patients are in the ward for a long time (weeks, or even months).
Some are frequently admitted patients. As nurses, we need to build rapport
with our patients and their families. When trust is gained, they will have
confidence that we will be able to nurse their loved ones back to health.
When I'm back home, my mother is my confidant. She lends me her listening
ears for my daily rant about work. But what makes me inspired to stay in
this career is the sense of fulfilment at the end of the day. Nursing is
a calling, not just a job.</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>It's always
good to be ambitious and plan ahead, but it's a smarter move to have a
backup plan in case your original plan fails. We must be open to learning
new things.</p>

<p><strong>对母校最美好的回忆:<br></strong>老师们的细心教导和同学们的相互扶持，使我能在这万变的社会中秉持着母校的的价值观——坚忍
RESILIENCE、 正直Integrity、 坚定Steadfastness、卓越Excellence、关心Care、勇敢Courage、感恩gratitude
——创出一番事业。</p>
<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>The dedication
from my teachers and the mutual supportiveness of the students enable me
to uphold the values of my alma mater - Perseverance, Steadfastness, Excellence,
Excellence, Care, Courage Gratitude - in this ever-changing society.</p>
<p><strong>用一个词来描述母校 - 作育英才！</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word<br></strong>Talent ! It is a home where
talent grows!</p>
<p><strong>你在离开母校之后走向什么职业道路？<br></strong>我是一只龙沟鱼，来自三巴旺一个务农的家庭。因为从小就跟随父母在农场里帮忙种植一些蔬菜，养殖一些猪、鸡、鸭、螃蟹、虾和观赏鱼,所以毕业后就带着母校教授予我的科学知识和母校的精神勇敢地继承父辈的农场并将他们的事业发扬光大！我的农场几经搬迁，几经奋斗，经历了风风雨雨，因为我坚定了母校的精神，终于这只龙沟鱼找到了一个家，也就是现在的NIPPON
KOI FARM.</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>I was a “Longkang fish”
(Longkang: dialect term for drain) from a farmer's family in Sembawang.
I grew up helping my parents grow vegetables on the farm, breeding pigs,
chickens, ducks, crabs, shrimps and ornamental fish. Not only did I learn
scientific knowledge from my teachers, AI also taught me to be courageous.
Since I graduated, armed with these gifts from AI, I inherited my father’s
farm and grew the business. There were many challenges along the way. I
brought my farm through multiple relocations and steered it through many
ups and downs. AI values guided me through my journey. Finally, this “Longkang
fish” has found a home, which is NIPPON KOI FARM.</p>
<p><strong>是什么激励你走向这条道路?<br></strong>激励我走向这条道路其实是一只卓越（excellence ）的狗，它一直跟随我的渔场多年，也是我最忠实的朋友！它勇敢（courage
）正直（integrity ）地帮我击退了多次的偷鱼贼！
<br>每当逢年过节的时候，我和我的哥哥必须回家吃团圆饭，而它坚定（steadfastness ）地守护着我的渔场。那时正好渔场被逼搬到淡滨尼尚未建好的渔场，我所有的鲤鱼鱼种还在林厝港渔场，所有邻居都搬走了。我们在停水停电的情况下，继续和我哥哥及三只狗守住重要的锦鲤鱼种！
<br>当淡滨尼的渔场建成之后，我想把我的狗儿也带过去，却被屋主拒绝了！我又舍不得把它们送去动物保护协会（SPCA） 。我心想发展商已经来拆除屋子了，这些狗儿肯定会跟他们那里去讨吃的，但我还是不放心，三天两头地回去送食物给它们，关心（care
）他们。当我最后一次回去看它们的时候，其它的狗儿已经离开，只有这只狗勇敢（courage ）坚忍（RESILIENCE ）地守住没有屋子，没有鱼池的空渔场。让我没有想到的是狗儿因为没有淡水而喝到海水，结果眼睛已经瞎了，但它还是能够分辨出我的脚步声，慢慢的走到我的身边低声的哀嚎！.
看到它这个样子，我伤心极了抱着它也哭了。当时我有一个强烈的感触，心想:我是一个人却连一只狗都救不了，而它却为我的渔场坚忠职守，不离不弃！我很伤心，所以我抱着一颗感恩（gratitude
）的心立志，将来我要拥有自己的渔场，不要再过着寄人篱下的生活！</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>Encouraging
me to continue on this path is actually a very loyal and resilient dog
which has followed my fishing grounds for many years and is my most loyal
friend! It bravely helped me to repel thieves who tried to steal the fishes
repeatedly!
<br>During the holidays, when my brother and I had to go home for a reunion
dinner, it was steadfastly guarding my fishing grounds. At that time, when
the fishing grounds were forced to move to an unbuilt fishing ground in
Tampines, all my carp species were removed from the Lim Chu Kang fishing
grounds and all the neighbours were removed. In the event of a power outage,
we continued to hold important Koi species with my brother and three dogs!
When Tampines fishing grounds were built, I wanted to bring my dog along,
but I was rejected by the owner! I am reluctant to send them to the SPCA.
I thought the developers have come to dismantle the house, and the dogs
are sure to go there with them to eat, but I still do not trust, go back
and send food to them every day, Care for them. When I went back to see
them for the last time, the other dogs had left, only the courage, RESILIENCE,
Hold empty fish farm without a house or fish pond. What I did not realize
was that the dog was blind because she had no fresh water and was drinking
seawater, but it was still able to tell my footsteps and walked slowly
to my side. See it like this, I cried hugging it very sadly. At that time
I had a strong feeling, I thought: I am a person cannot even save a dog,
but it is my loyalty to my fishing farm, never betray! I am very sad, so
I am determined to hold a gratitude heart _ in the future I want to have
their own fishing grounds, do not live a hedgerow life!</p>
<p><strong>对今日的母校学生有什么忠告？<br></strong>人生的道路是靠自己走出来的！最大的敌人就是自己，只有每天都要自我挑战才能使自己进步，而学校和老师只能教导引导你。社会是很现实，也是很残酷的，所谓适者生存，能者多劳,自己不努力就要被淘汰.
学生要有自信、要有一个大目标、要有一个奔跑追求的方向。通过坚持不懈的努力才能成功！</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>You craft your
own path towards your destiny! You are your biggest enemy. School and teachers
can only teach and guide you but you can only continue to improve when
you challenge yourself every single day. The society is very realistic
and harsh. Remember, it is “Survival of the Fittest”. As the saying goes,
“An able man is always busy”, one will become obsolete if we do not work
hard. Students need to be confident and dare to dream big. One can only
achieve success by putting in unremitting efforts and being resilient!</p>

<p><strong>Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br></strong>The very first
speech I did as Head Prefect for the (then called) Speech Day 2001, where
I was up on the school hall podium addressing the whole school and had
to pronounce the very first Chinese phrase in my life (which was part of
my speech), 失败是成功之母 to a resounding applause from the audience. It was
very overwhelming and humbling to receive such support despite my rusty
hanyu pinyin!</p>
<p><strong>Describe AI in one word<br></strong>Nostalgic!</p>
<p><strong>What did you do after AI?<br></strong>After I graduated from AI,
I pursued my dream and career interest, which was to become a pilot. I
had dreams of becoming an RSAF fighter pilot, however that did not materialize,
and so I settled to become a general aviation pilot instead.</p>
<p>I actually took a more unconventional approach to education. I was in
Anderson Junior College in Yio Chu Kang. After graduating from Junior College,
I found that there was no route to realise my passion and dream for aviation.
The polytechnics did not have any aviation courses then (the very first
aerospace course only opened in 2003, after I had already enrolled into
AJC). Therefore, after I graduated from AJC, I served my National Service
first. During my time in NS, I had a long thought about my education path
and did a lot of research. Finally, I made up my mind to enrol back into
Polytechnic, as I did not want to go into University studying in a course
that I did not really like. Therefore, I went back to Singapore Polytechnic
after National Service and got into the Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering
(DARE) course. It was the best decision of my life! I am one of the few
people who took the road less travelled by, and in doing that, I earned
both an A-level certificate as well as a polytechnic Diploma!</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to go down this career path?<br></strong>I guess
my father largely influenced me to go down this career path. Back during
my formative years as a child, he used to bring me to air shows and it
was during this time that my interest in aviation was piqued and grew.
My father also bought me my very first PC game; it was a fighter jet simulation
and he even went all the way to buy me a joystick to fly it! He was supportive
of my interest. What became a mere hobby soon evolved to become a dream
and then a lifelong ambition. It has taken me this far now and I am glad
I pursued it!</p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our students of today?<br></strong>Don’t be afraid
to pursue your dreams, no matter how unconventional the path you take.
Your passion will bring you far; let it guide you and do not stop until
you get whatever you desire. I have always believed in the power of passion;
“Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life,”
Confucius once said. Live by these words of wisdom, and you will always
be happy.</p>
