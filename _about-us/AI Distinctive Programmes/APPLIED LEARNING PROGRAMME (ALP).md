<p><strong>What is the aim of the ALP?<br /></strong>Our ALP aims to develop our students for the future while keeping them grounded in strong values and a concern for others in the community .Through the ALP, students grow to be critical thinkers, confident communicators and effective and discerning users of media, who care for others in the community.</p>

<p><strong>Does every AI student go through the ALP?<br /></strong>Yes, all students experience the ALP lessons in Secondary 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Beyond lessons, students are also exposed to enrichment programmes such as talks with industry experts, to help them better understand developments in the real world.</p>
<p>Students who are keen to deepen their skills further can sign up for ALP-related competitions or workshops when these opportunities arise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do students learn in ALP Lessons?&nbsp;<br /></strong>Our students explore real-life issues in society, taking direction from larger national policies in Singapore such as&nbsp;<strong>Smart Nation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Sustainability</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Critical Thinkers</em></strong>. In lessons, students analyse societal issues so as to better understand their causes and implications from multiple perspectives. In doing so, students are guided in making interdisciplinary connections, bringing together what they have learned in other subjects such the Humanities, Languages, Art, Science, Mathematics and Citizenship and Character Education. Why is this important?</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly external environments can change, affecting industries, livelihoods, and even the way we work and learn. Our students must be prepared for such disruptions in future. They must possess the flexibility of mind to exploit new opportunities in times of change. This ability to see across disciplines, as honed in our ALP, will help them do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Confident Communicators with a Heart for Others</em></strong>. Beyond just understanding societal issues, students need to be able to articulate their findings so as to effect change. In lessons, students learn how to create meaningful digital products (e.g., digital infographics, comics, videos) so as to communicate what they have learned and the solutions they have generated. The aim is to persuade others around them to do their part for society.</p>
<p><strong><em>Effective and Discerning Users of Media</em></strong>. In our ALP, students learn to be more discerning when accessing information online. They hone their skills in distinguishing reliable information from fake news and learn how the media can, at times, portray information from a certain angle to achieve a desired outcome.</p>
