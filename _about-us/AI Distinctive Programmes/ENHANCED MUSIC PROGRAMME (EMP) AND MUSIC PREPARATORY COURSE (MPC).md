<h3>Enhanced Music Programme (EMP)</h3>
<p>AISS is one of only four EMP (Enhanced Music Programme) schools in Singapore. We are also an O-Level Music Centre for students across Singapore who want to offer O-Level Music. As one of our school&rsquo;s signature programmes, the AISS EMP is a four-year programme for Secondary One to Four students, culminating in the GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level Music examinations.</p>
<p>Our unique programme includes talent identification and development, mentorships and collaborations with other institutions, myriad opportunities for exposure and experiences outside the classroom, and a supportive whole-school musical culture. Our cutting-edge music technology-based curriculum encourages experimentation and expression, and many opportunities to perform and compose music using music technology.</p>
<p>Join us to experience a unique musical journey!</p>

<p><strong><u>Key features of the syllabus</u></strong></p>
<p>Our comprehensive curriculum caters to various interests and aptitude levels. Students benefit from the study of Western and Asian music, Jazz and Pop, music composition, and music theory. Additionally, students in the EMP will get opportunities to perform as soloists or in ensembles, benefit from music workshops and masterclasses, and attend learning journeys and internships with local arts organisations and institutions.</p>
<p>We develop students&rsquo; musical knowledge and skills and aim to build up students&rsquo; competence and confidence in music in order for them to study music at a higher level. The spiral curriculum introduces topics at a foundational level, and includes foundational music skills such as elements of music, music theory, music history, aural skills, composition skills, as well as solo and ensemble performance skills.</p>
<p>Our students also benefit from a comprehensive enrichment programme. Students experience a wide range of musical activities in and outside of the classroom, in order to develop skills and competencies for more advanced studies in music, or to gain awareness of potential careers in Music.</p>
<p><strong><u>Selection Test Information</u></strong></p>
<p>We conduct auditions and interviews throughout the year as part of our talent identification process. Suitable candidates in Secondary 1 and 2 can be accepted into the programme.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Success Stories</u></strong></p>
