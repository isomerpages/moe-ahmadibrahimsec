<h3>Enhanced Music Programme (EMP)</h3>
<p>AISS is one of only four EMP (Enhanced Music Programme) schools in Singapore. We are also an O-Level Music Centre for students across Singapore who want to offer O-Level Music. As one of our school&rsquo;s signature programmes, the AISS EMP is a four-year programme for Secondary One to Four students, culminating in the GCE &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level Music examinations.</p>
<p>Our unique programme includes talent identification and development, mentorships and collaborations with other institutions, myriad opportunities for exposure and experiences outside the classroom, and a supportive whole-school musical culture. Our cutting-edge music technology-based curriculum encourages experimentation and expression, and many opportunities to perform and compose music using music technology.</p>
<p>Join us to experience a unique musical journey!</p>
