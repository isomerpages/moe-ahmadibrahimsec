<p>Dear students, parents, and partners,</p>
<p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary, we
are a school where we are committed in nurturing our students to be gentlemen
and ladies who care, learn, and excel for our school and our nation!</p>
<p>As the 11th principal of a school with a rich and distinctive history,
since our founding in 1962, I am privileged to be given this opportunity
to continue the work of our past school leaders and highly dedicated staff
in preparing our students to be self-directed lifelong learners. With changes
in the education landscape, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary is well positioned
in redefining secondary education, and journeying together with staff,
alumni, and partners, in our continued Vision and Mission for our AI students.</p>
<p>In Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary, our students’ can look forward to an exciting
and diverse range of special programmes designed to help them gain the
confidence, values, and competencies to excel in life after secondary education.
Our ALP and LLP is highly distinctive in defining our students’ school
experience and school identity. In addition, we are one of the few schools
offering the Enhanced Music Programme (EMP), since 2016, allowing aspiring
or talented students to pursuit G3 Music or Higher Music. Lower Secondary
students can also enjoy a two-year Music Preparatory Course.</p>
<p>As our society slowly recognises and embraces all learners and becomes
more inclusive, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary has been a leader in inclusive
education, since 1967, under the Open Education Programme for the blind,
whereby visually impaired students are integrated into mainstream. We will
continue to grow and strengthen as a school that fully embraces all learners
through highly committed, caring and competent teachers.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I will continue to work closely with our alumnus and
partners to continue Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary’s tradition of ensuring strong
academic foundations, rooted on strong values, and with the culture of
excellence in all areas of our students’ holistic development.</p>
<p>Do join us in our next lap as we jointly move onto the next lap in AI’s
growth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With Integrity and Compassion,</p>
<p>Mr Goh Soon Hoe,</p>
<p>Principal, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary</p>
