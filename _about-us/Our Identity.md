<h3><strong>School Crest</strong></h3>
<p>The torch, with its glowing red flame, symbolizes the light of integrity
and the warmth of compassion. It inspires every student to bear the truth,
stand up for righteousness and at the same time, have a heart for others,
and serve those in need.
<br>
<br>The combination of the twirling background design together with the torch
is a stylized depiction of the letters, "ai', the abbreviated form of the
school’s name, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School.
<br>
<br>Green represents our shared value of harmony in a multi-racial, multi-religious
school and the colour silver, our perseverance in the pursuit of excellence.</p>
