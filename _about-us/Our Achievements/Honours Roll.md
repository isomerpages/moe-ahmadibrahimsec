<p>Izwan Bin Indra (3E2) was declared 2018 Chong Pang's Next Top Speaker
after battling with 8 other finalists. He exuded commanding stage presence
and delivered his speech with conviction and flair. A pertinent speech
(entitled Anti-social Social Network) wrapped in sincerity and adorned
with a sprinkle of humour, it made us laugh, and it made us think. He also
won the Crowd Favourite for Prepared Speech. Watch Izwan in action below.

<p>One may say it was beginner’s luck that 4 students bagged a trophy in
their maiden debate competition, but a stroke of luck it wasn’t. With all
the weeks of practice, mock debates with teachers, and video-calling to
discuss and hone their arguments, these Pure Literature students from 4E3
demonstrated nothing less than pure grit and determination, scrutinising
two poems in preparation for the Unseen Poetry Debate. New and inexperienced
in debate they might have been, but won the praise of the judges they did
for their close analysis. Winning despite being up against a debate-trained
team from Evergreen Secondary School really gave these 4 young ladies a
boost of confidence! Congratulations, Sarah, Sarefina, Serena and Chi Rou!</p>

<h4><strong>AISS's EMP &amp; MPC Students Featured in Singapore Rhapsodies at the National Gallery Singapore</strong></h4>

the pianos she rehearsed on.</p>
