<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>The Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership &amp; Service (EAGLES)
was introduced in 2001 to recognise students' leadership qualities, excellence
in non-academic activities, and service to community and schools. This
yearly award is open to students who are Singapore Citizens. With effect
from 2024, EAGLES was enhanced to recognise students with consistent and
exemplary demonstration of Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC).
This enhancement supports the broader goal of nurturing students holistically
and preparing them to thrive in a fast-changing, complex, and interconnected
world.</p>
