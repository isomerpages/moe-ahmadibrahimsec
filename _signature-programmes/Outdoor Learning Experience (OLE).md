<h4><strong>Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS)</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary
School (AISS) is an integral part of the school's Learning for Life Programme
(LLP), designed to provide students with a diverse range of experiences
aimed at developing their social-emotional competencies and fostering strong
values. Since its inception in 2005, OLE has been instrumental in creating
collective memories for successive batches of AI students, shaping the
school's identity and heritage.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Key Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The school’s LLP- Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) is a broad-based
developmental programme that develops our students’ strength of character
through three main domains of <em><u>Outdoor Education; Personal and Social Development; and Environmental Awareness</u></em>.
Through LLP, students are afforded the opportunity to engage with both
natural and urban environments, from familiar surroundings to unexplored
locations, while instilling a sense of responsibility towards the community
and the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our inclusive approach for OLE affords opportunities for all students
including our visually impaired students; both abled and differently abled
to participate, benefit, learn and grow. &nbsp;</p>
