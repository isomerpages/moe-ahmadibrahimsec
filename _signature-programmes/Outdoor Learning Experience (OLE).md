<h4><strong>Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS)</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary
School (AISS) is an integral part of the school's Learning for Life Programme
(LLP), designed to provide students with a diverse range of experiences
aimed at developing their social-emotional competencies and fostering strong
values. Since its inception in 2005, OLE has been instrumental in creating
collective memories for successive batches of AI students, shaping the
school's identity and heritage.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Key Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The school’s LLP- Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) is a broad-based
developmental programme that develops our students’ strength of character
through three main domains of <em><u>Outdoor Education; Personal and Social Development; and Environmental Awareness</u></em>.
Through LLP, students are afforded the opportunity to engage with both
natural and urban environments, from familiar surroundings to unexplored
locations, while instilling a sense of responsibility towards the community
and the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our inclusive approach for OLE affords opportunities for all students
including our visually impaired students; both abled and differently abled
to participate, benefit, learn and grow. &nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>LLP Framework</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Tier 1</strong>
<br><u>Broad-based developmental programme, augmenting the PE-OE Curriculum</u>
</p>
<p>Aligned with the Physical Education and Outdoor Education (PE-OE) Curriculum,
OLE is designed to enhance students' movement competence and lifestyle
behaviours. In the PE-OE Curriculum, students would learn a series of modular
activities. The lessons provide exposure to a wide range of developmental
programmes, enabling students to develop essential outdoor skills through
physical activities, while fostering an attitude of care and appreciation
for the environment.</p>
<p><u>Development of Social-Emotional Competencies</u>
<br>Through OLE, students not only acquire outdoor skills, develop lifelong
learning mindsets, resilience, and adaptability but also cultivate a sense
of responsibility, care, and concern for others. The programme encourages
the development of healthy identities and social-emotional competencies,
fostering qualities such as resilience and steadfastness. Activities such
as team building, hiking, cycling, outdoor cooking, and kayaking are just
a few examples of the experiences that students can expect during their
time at AISS.</p>
<p><u>Community Engagement and Environmental Appreciation</u>
<br>Secondary 1 to 3 students would attend OLE as a cohort where students
get the opportunity to form connections with the community and gain a deeper
appreciation of the environment. Through OLE, students develop a sense
of rootedness and responsibility towards the community, contributing to
their holistic development as individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2</strong>
<br>As part of the school’s talent development, opportunities are extended
to students who have interest, attune to and have the aptitude for outdoor
activities, to be Outdoor Leaders (OL).&nbsp; OL are provided with the
opportunities to develop, engage and contribute to the community. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Platforms to develop their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking</u>
<br>Natural platforms are provided for OL to demonstrate skills in leadership,
facilitation, and event management. These opportunities are structured
as part of cohort programmes i.e. Sec 1 Orientation, Sec 2 OLE and the
school-wide Sports Carnival.</p>
<p><u>External participation with community</u>
<br>Students have the opportunity to attend external programmes such as the
Khatib Bongsu Orientation and Engagement Session, jointly organised by
our partners, Nee Soon East Community Centre and People’s Association to
develop their critical, adaptive and inventive thinking. As part of environmental
awareness, our students get to kayak through the mangrove forest at Khatib
Bongsu. While doing so, our students would also clean up and explore possibilities,
generate novel and useful ideas for the community as they provide valuable
feedback to the authorities on how the area can be developed for future
public use and visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Student Leaders’ training &amp; development</u></a>
</p>
<p>As part of OL’s development, they would be provided with training that
would include knowledge on Risk Assessment Management System (RAMS) where
students are able to identify possible hazards in different activities
and take reasonably practicable measures to eliminate or reduce the potential
risks. As student leaders, they would also undergo internal milestone student
leadership training.</p>
<p>OLE at AISS is a testament to the school's commitment to provide students
with a well-rounded education that goes beyond the classroom, nurturing
their character and values while fostering a strong connection with the
environment and the community. Over the years, OLE has provided the unique
collective memories that define the AI identity and heritage for many batches
of AI students long after they graduated from school.</p>
