<p>Izwan Bin Indra (3E2) was declared 2018 Chong Pang's Next Top Speaker after battling with 8 other finalists. He exuded commanding stage presence and delivered his speech with conviction and flair. A pertinent speech (entitled Anti-social Social Network) wrapped in sincerity and adorned with a sprinkle of humour, it made us laugh, and it made us think. He also won the Crowd Favourite for Prepared Speech. Watch Izwan in action below.<br /></p>
