<p>Izwan Bin Indra (3E2) was declared 2018 Chong Pang's Next Top Speaker after battling with 8 other finalists. He exuded commanding stage presence and delivered his speech with conviction and flair. A pertinent speech (entitled Anti-social Social Network) wrapped in sincerity and adorned with a sprinkle of humour, it made us laugh, and it made us think. He also won the Crowd Favourite for Prepared Speech. Watch Izwan in action below.<br /></p>

<h4><strong>Winner of Unseen Poetry Debate at National Schools Literature Festival</strong></h4>
<img src="/images/Winner-of-Unseen-Poetry-Debate-at-National-Schools-Literature-Festival.jpg">
<p>One may say it was beginner&rsquo;s luck that 4 students bagged a trophy in their maiden debate competition, but a stroke of luck it wasn&rsquo;t. With all the weeks of practice, mock debates with teachers, and video-calling to discuss and hone their arguments, these Pure Literature students from 4E3 demonstrated nothing less than pure grit and determination, scrutinising two poems in preparation for the Unseen Poetry Debate. New and inexperienced in debate they might have been, but won the praise of the judges they did for their close analysis. Winning despite being up against a debate-trained team from Evergreen Secondary School really gave these 4 young ladies a boost of confidence! Congratulations, Sarah, Sarefina, Serena and Chi Rou!</p>
<p>Winners<br />1. Sarah Tan Xin Hui 4E3<br />2. Sarefina Sindhu Victor 4E3<br />3. Yong Yi Xuan, Serena 4E3<br />4. Tay Chi Rou 4E3</p>
