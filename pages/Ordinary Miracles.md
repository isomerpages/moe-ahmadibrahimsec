We call it Ordinary Miracles@AI. It gives students the opportunity to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates.</p>
<p>Ordinary Miracles@AI could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like OLE, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit shown during inter-class games, Sports Carnival, Community Day and Green Day. More often than not, the ordinary miracles we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the minds and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little things with huge significance and deep impact. Frequently, students would write about the heartfelt sharing during class Circle Time, a kind gesture of care from teachers and classmates, and of course, the warm feeling of family as the class partakes in the well-loved Breakfast with Form Teachers. Ordinary Miracles@AI are about people and relationships.</p>
<p>So, as you browse the school website, enter our world and celebrate the ordinary miracles with us. This collection of ordinary miracles tells of who we are and what makes&nbsp;<strong>AI EXTRAORDINARY</strong>...</p>

They ate the combat rations that NS men eat, tried out the signal sets used for communications and had a dialogue session with the Commanding Officer of the Battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Debra Koh. Through the SSPP, cadets realised that school values such as resilience and excellence will also be useful in their future as a full-time National Service man.</p>

<p>AI student Kalaivani d/o Regupathy represented Singapore to perform at the ChildAid Asia Tokyo 2018, held at the Suntory Hall on 20 May 2018. This year's concert showcased performances by young talents from Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Proceeds will be used to support needy children through art workshops and international cultural events.</p>
<p>Says Kalaivani of her experience: "I am really grateful for being able to represent Singapore for the ChildAid Asia Tokyo. I learnt many things about the Japanese culture and many different values from the other performers that I worked with. Even though I couldn't communicate with the Japanese emcees that I worked with, I was able to get along with them easily and they were amazing to work with!"</p>
<p>Kalaivani was talent-identified through the school's General Music Programme into the 10Square Youth Arts Incubation Programme when she was in Secondary Two. A recipient of the Business Times' Budding Artists Fund, she has benefited from the arts training and many performance opportunities with the programme.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Kalaivani! We're glad you had a great experience!</p>

<p>"Dear Principal, greetings to you!</p>
<p>I am writing this to appreciate the Secondary 4 students who were walking about Chong Pang today to show kindness to the society. I saw them while having my breakfast and asked them and they explained very nicely and I had a note of encouragement myself and wrote for others. Took some pictures and then saw them again and took a wefie together.</p>
<p>Why I did this? I know the encouragers need that touch too. I wanted to appreciate them and also appreciate yourself and the school leadership for stepping out into the society to show care and love in practical ways. I managed to see the form teacher and one other DNT teacher too and appreciated them too.</p>
<p>Well done Ahmad Ibrahim and I want to personally wish and bless all taking their exams this year. God bless!</p>

<p>Our school was invited to perform on Friday 29 June 2018, and Sunday 1 July 2018 as part of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Celebrations 2018 at the Padang Atrium at National Gallery Singapore. A mixture of 16 Secondary 2 and 3 students were selected and trained for the 30-minute performance, with the guidance of an industry practitioner, Mr Mervin Wong.</p>
<p>This experience inspired the students and aroused their curiosities to explore the possibilities in creative music making with technology. The performers acquired knowledge on the elements of live music creation and performance, forging new friendships in the process. As many students did not have any music background prior to this project, it was a truly empowering and refreshing experience for the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI is proud to have partnered with Arts Education Branch for this project, and look forward to bringing to the public more talents of AI!</p>

<h4>AI OLE featured in SingTeach - A Classroom Without Walls</h4>

<h3>AI Students received commendation</h3>
<p>A member of the public shared with the school in the first week of Term 3, 2016:</p>
<p><strong><em>‘I am writing in to you to express my gratitude to a group of your young students for their responsible act this afternoon.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We were all travelling in SMRT bus no. 965 at around 3pm when we saw smoke emitting from the bus along Gambas Avenue. A group of your students approached the lady driver and told her about the smoke in Mandarin. A female student then translated it to us and advised everyone to remain calm. The driver was reluctant to open the door because we were in the middle of the road and letting us off is very dangerous and may cause an accident. Your students convinced the driver and even helped her stop all oncoming traffic before letting us all alight safely to the side of the road. Their act of selflessness is truly commendable and is definitely praiseworthy.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>I am sorry as I am unable to take their names down. Do convey my gratitude to them and a job well done for their act.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Thank you.’</em></strong></p>

<p>It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game...</p>
<p>On the 18 Sep 2015, at Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC) Colours Award Ceremony held at CHIJ St Theresa’s Convent, the SSSC Chairman spoke at length about the spirit and values of Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary students.</p>
<p>Here is part of speech:</p>
<p>“<em><strong>Let me share with you about what Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School’s ‘B’ Division Basketball girls team did at the National School Games. With just a few minutes to go, Ahmad Ibrahim gained possession of the ball in a neck to neck game. As Ahmad Ibrahim was trying to advance, one of the players from the defending team tripped and fell.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ahmad Ibrahim chose to stop play to check on the opposing player who had fallen. Ahmad Ibrahim didn’t win that game. However, their teacher was immensely proud of the values and sportsmanship that his students had exhibited. In sports, it is extremely difficult to make such a moral decision, especially when you know that the decision might cost you the game.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>However, for players of Ahmad Ibrahim, we applaud their courage to stand up for what they believe was right.</strong></em>”</p>

<h3>Primary school teacher thanked AI student for returning her bag left on a bus</h3>
<p>Helping someone without the expectation of getting something in return is important...</p>
<p>On the 17th of September, an Ahmad Ibrahim (AI) student found a primary school teacher’s bag that had been left on a bus and then safely returned it to the primary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, our school received an appreciation email from the primary school teacher. She expressed her heartfelt gratitude to an AISS boy who picked up her bag left on a bus and later returned it to her.</p>
<p>“This morning at about 7 a.m., in my hurry, I alighted from the bus without my bag. I called up Yishun bus interchange but the staff told me they did not find anything. It was not until about 3p.m. when one of your boys came to my school to return the bag. He had apparently carried it to school and kept it with him so that he could return me after school. Unfortunately, I did not manage to thank him personally for his kind gesture so I did not get his name.</p>
<p>I hope you would highlight this kind act performed by one of your students to the school. This is a true testament to our work in education and the important role of schools in developing concerned citizens of tomorrow:) Good job AI!”</p>
<p>Our Principal shared the email with the whole school at a morning assembly. The school is proud of AI students who live out the school values of care and responsibility in their actions and behaviours. The action of the AI student has certainly warmed many hearts.</p>

<p>On our Community Day held on 13 Mar 2015, our students fanned out with dedication to clean up Sembawang park during their service learning.</p>
<p>We are heartened to receive an email from a member of the public who said “Well done, boys and girls” together with photos of our students cleaning the Sembawang Park and encouraging the residents to work together towards a clean and green Singapore.</p>
<p>Service Learning provides opportunity for every AI student to live out Encik Ahmad Ibrahim’s spirit of service to the community, to be a good ambassador of the school and to the community, and to demonstrate values in action.</p>
