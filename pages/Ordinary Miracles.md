We call it Ordinary Miracles@AI. It gives students the opportunity to express what they appreciate of the school, teachers and classmates.</p>
<p>Ordinary Miracles@AI could be amazing accomplishments by individuals, teams and classes. They are also cherished memories of school events like OLE, and the moment of pride winning a class competition. Or times when teachers and students are inspired by the team work and class spirit shown during inter-class games, Sports Carnival, Community Day and Green Day. More often than not, the ordinary miracles we love are the simple, ordinary things we do in our daily interactions that touch a heart, enlighten the minds and bring laughter to all. What we call - Little things with huge significance and deep impact. Frequently, students would write about the heartfelt sharing during class Circle Time, a kind gesture of care from teachers and classmates, and of course, the warm feeling of family as the class partakes in the well-loved Breakfast with Form Teachers. Ordinary Miracles@AI are about people and relationships.</p>
<p>So, as you browse the school website, enter our world and celebrate the ordinary miracles with us. This collection of ordinary miracles tells of who we are and what makes&nbsp;<strong>AI EXTRAORDINARY</strong>...</p>

<p>NCC cadets from AI participated in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) &ndash; Schools Partnership Programme (SSPP) on 5 September 2018 during the September school holidays. They visited the 16th&nbsp; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) Battalion at Mandai Hill Camp. The cadets experienced authentic National Service (NS) life. They ate the combat rations that NS men eat, tried out the signal sets used for communications and had a dialogue session with the Commanding Officer of the Battalion, Lieutenant-Colonel (LTC) Debra Koh. Through the SSPP, cadets realised that school values such as resilience and excellence will also be useful in their future as a full-time National Service man.</p>

<p>AI student Kalaivani d/o Regupathy represented Singapore to perform at the ChildAid Asia Tokyo 2018, held at the Suntory Hall on 20 May 2018. This year's concert showcased performances by young talents from Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Proceeds will be used to support needy children through art workshops and international cultural events.</p>
<p>Says Kalaivani of her experience: "I am really grateful for being able to represent Singapore for the ChildAid Asia Tokyo. I learnt many things about the Japanese culture and many different values from the other performers that I worked with. Even though I couldn't communicate with the Japanese emcees that I worked with, I was able to get along with them easily and they were amazing to work with!"</p>
<p>Kalaivani was talent-identified through the school's General Music Programme into the 10Square Youth Arts Incubation Programme when she was in Secondary Two. A recipient of the Business Times' Budding Artists Fund, she has benefited from the arts training and many performance opportunities with the programme.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Kalaivani! We're glad you had a great experience!</p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Reverend Israel Selvam with our Sec 4E4 students</strong></p>
<p>"Dear Principal, greetings to you!</p>
<p>I am writing this to appreciate the Secondary 4 students who were walking about Chong Pang today to show kindness to the society. I saw them while having my breakfast and asked them and they explained very nicely and I had a note of encouragement myself and wrote for others. Took some pictures and then saw them again and took a wefie together.</p>
<p>Why I did this? I know the encouragers need that touch too. I wanted to appreciate them and also appreciate yourself and the school leadership for stepping out into the society to show care and love in practical ways. I managed to see the form teacher and one other DNT teacher too and appreciated them too.</p>
<p>Well done Ahmad Ibrahim and I want to personally wish and bless all taking their exams this year. God bless!</p>
<p>Regards<br />Israel Selvam (Reverend)<br />Yishun Christian Church (Anglican)"</p>
<h3>Appreciation from the public</h3>
	<p>"Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I would like to show my deepest gratitude to 2 of your students Mingqian (3N1) and Guo Jie (2N2) for returning my wallet back to me.</p>
<p>This just happened today at 5pm, when I received a unknown call from one of the above mention girl, who told me I dropped my wallet at the bus-stop and the girls waited patiently as I rush down.</p>
<p>The girls have been honest and responsible in their action as a student of your school and definitely thanks to their parents who have good upbringing of their children&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Regards<br />Nisha"</p>

<p>Our school was invited to perform on Friday 29 June 2018, and Sunday 1 July 2018 as part of the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Celebrations 2018 at the Padang Atrium at National Gallery Singapore. A mixture of 16 Secondary 2 and 3 students were selected and trained for the 30-minute performance, with the guidance of an industry practitioner, Mr Mervin Wong.</p>
<p>This experience inspired the students and aroused their curiosities to explore the possibilities in creative music making with technology. The performers acquired knowledge on the elements of live music creation and performance, forging new friendships in the process. As many students did not have any music background prior to this project, it was a truly empowering and refreshing experience for the students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI is proud to have partnered with Arts Education Branch for this project, and look forward to bringing to the public more talents of AI!</p>
