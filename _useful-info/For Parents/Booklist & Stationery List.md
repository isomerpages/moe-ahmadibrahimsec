#### End-of-Year Sales and Collection of Textbooks and School Attire for Sec 2 to 5 Students of Academic Year 2024
The school textbooks and attire can be purchased from our approved vendors either online* or directly at the school during specified dates (see walk-in purchase).

Students are advised to purchase school textbooks from our school bookshop vendor to ensure the correct editions and titles are selected as prescribed by the school

<b><u>STUDENTS OFFERED SBB SUBJECTS</u></b><br>
Students who are uncertain about whether they will be offered SBB subjects should refrain from purchasing textbooks at this time. Please be aware that purchases from our school bookshop are non-refundable, and only books in their original condition can be exchanged. For instance, books with students' names written in them cannot be exchanged.

<b><u>MOE FAS AND SCHOOL-BASED FAS STUDENTS</u></b><br>
Online purchase will not be available. Upon FAS approval, the school will contact parents to arrange for the collection of the approval letter. Parents who receive FAS approval from other schools are advised to contact our General Office to make an appointment for the collection of the approval letter from our school.

<b><u>Walk-In Purchase</u></b><br>
As part of safe management measures, the school strongly encourages appointments to be made for walk-in purchase of textbooks. Those with scheduled appointment will receive priority at the bookstore. Those who walk-in without an appointment will have to wait for the next available opening. 

Appointments can made at our vendor [website](https://www.pacificbookstores.com) . The appointment system will be available from 13 Nov. 

The user guide for the appointment system is attached.
* 


**NB: This e-appointment will allow entry into the school for purchase from all vendors (i.e. textbooks and school attire).**

Those who walk-in without an appointment will have to wait for the next available opening.
