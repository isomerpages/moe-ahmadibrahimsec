#### End-of-Year Sales and Collection of Textbooks and School Attire for Sec 2 to 5 Students of Academic Year 2024
The school textbooks and attire can be purchased from our approved vendors either online* or directly at the school during specified dates (see walk-in purchase).

Students are advised to purchase school textbooks from our school bookshop vendor to ensure the correct editions and titles are selected as prescribed by the school

<b><u>STUDENTS OFFERED SBB SUBJECTS</u></b><br>
Students who are uncertain about whether they will be offered SBB subjects should refrain from purchasing textbooks at this time. Please be aware that purchases from our school bookshop are non-refundable, and only books in their original condition can be exchanged. For instance, books with students' names written in them cannot be exchanged.

<b><u>MOE FAS AND SCHOOL-BASED FAS STUDENTS</u></b><br>
Online purchase will not be available. Upon FAS approval, the school will contact parents to arrange for the collection of the approval letter. Parents who receive FAS approval from other schools are advised to contact our General Office to make an appointment for the collection of the approval letter from our school.

Appointments can made at our vendor [website](https://www.pacificbookstores.com) . The appointment system will be available from 13 Nov.
