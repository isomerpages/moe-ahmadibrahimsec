<h4><strong><em>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</em></strong></h4>
<p>HBL provides students the opportunity to develop the mindset and habits
for self-directed learning as well as time to pursue their interests. It
takes place fortnightly, based on MOE guidelines for all secondary schools.&nbsp;
The school takes the following approach and structure for HBL:</p>
<table style="minWidth: 50px">
<colgroup>
<col>
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Semester 1</strong>
</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Semester 2</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Even-week Fridays</strong>
</p>
<p>(to regulate routines and reinforce positive learning habits)</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Floating days</strong>
</p>
<p>(in support of National Examinations)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
