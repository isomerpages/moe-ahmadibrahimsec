<h3>Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership &amp; Service (EAGLES) 2024</h3>
<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>The Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership &amp; Service (EAGLES)
was introduced in 2001 to recognise students' leadership qualities, excellence
in non-academic activities, and service to community and schools. This
yearly award is open to students who are Singapore Citizens. With effect
from 2024, EAGLES is enhanced to recognise students with consistent and
exemplary demonstration of Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC).
This enhancement was made to recognise students’ holistic development.
It is also part of the larger goal to prepare Singaporeans to thrive in
a fast-changing, complex, and inter-connected world, by encouraging the
development and application of future-ready competencies.</p>
<h4>The eligibility criteria of the award are as follows:</h4>
