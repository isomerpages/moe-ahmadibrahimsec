<h2>Full Subject Based Banding (Full SBB)</h2>
<p>Full SBB&nbsp;is part of MOE&amp;#39;s ongoing efforts to nurture the
joy of learning and develop multiple</p>
<p>pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each</p>
<p>subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests
and learning needs.</p>
<p>What this means is that:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) courses, and
our Secondary One students will be placed in&nbsp;mixed form classes&nbsp;where
they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lower secondary students will learn a set of common curriculum subjects
together in their form classes. The common curriculum subjects includes
Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Art, Design &amp; Technology
(D&amp;T), Food &amp;amp; Consumer Education (FCE), Music and Physical
Education (PE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the start of Secondary One (S1), eligible students can offer English
Language (EL), Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Mathematics and Science at
a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each
of these subjects. Beyond the start of S1, eligible students will also
be able to offer Humanities subjects (Geography, History, and Literature
in English) at a more demanding level based on their aptitude for and interest
in these subjects at S1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary Four, students will sit for the Singapore-Cambridge
Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations.</p>
</li>
</ol>

The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based

<p>Students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with each form class
comprising students taking different courses. Mixed form classes present
more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking
different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.
<br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a
common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would
allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together
in these subjects.
<br>These subjects are:
<br>- Art
<br>- Character and Citizenship Education
<br>- Design and Technology
<br>- Food and Consumer Education
<br>- Music
<br>- Physical Education
<br>
<br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different
learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.
<br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will
be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for
taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary
One is based on students' PSLE AL Score for each subject.</p>
