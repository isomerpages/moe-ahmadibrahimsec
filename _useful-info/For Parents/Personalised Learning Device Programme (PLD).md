# **National Digital Literacy Programme**<br>
At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).

# **Personal Learning Device**<br>
Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) will truly transform the learning environment as it allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will support the development of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as self-directed and collaborative learners.

AISS has selected the Lenovo Chromebook as its PLD offering since 2021. Despite its small size, it is feature packed with a responsive 11.6″ touchscreen and upgraded components like its CPU, RAM and storage. With 3 years of warranty and insurance coverage, it offers superb value for money and will provide students with many good years of learning and productivity.

# **Important Actions For Parents**<br>
Parents/guardians will receive a letter from the school via Parents’ Gateway or hardcopy with details about the purchase of PLD by mid January.

Please submit the following consent forms in order for the school to begin processing the purchase of a PLD for your child/ward.

*   Intent to Purchase PLD
*   Edusave Withdrawal (for SC only)
*   Authorisation to collect PLD
*   Application for Subsidy (PR/IS)

Singapore Citizens, please make an online submission at&nbsp;[https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin](https://go.gov.sg/pdlpadmin)&nbsp;after the Parents’ Gateway notification.

Permanent Residents/International Students, please submit the hardcopy letter to your child’s/ward’s Form Teacher.

# **Financial Assistance**<br>
Subsidies are available to students who require financial assistance. Singapore Citizens who are already on MOE FAS or School-based FAS will automatically qualify for these subsidies and do not need to take any action.

Permanent Residents (PR) and International Students (IS) who need support can apply for subsidies, particularly those whose Gross Household Income (GHI) is below $4400 or Per Capita Income (PCI) is below $1100. If your child qualifies for a subsidy, please submit Annex D “Application for Subsidy for PLD”.
