<p><strong>National Digital Literacy Programme<br /></strong>At MOE&rsquo;s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD).</p>
<p><strong>Personal Learning Device<br /></strong>Personal Learning Devices (PLDs) will truly transform the learning environment as it allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning. The use of the personal learning devices for teaching and learning will support the development of digital literacies in our students as well as develop them as self-directed and collaborative learners.</p>
<p>AISS has selected the Lenovo Chromebook Gen 2 as its PLD offering since 2021. Despite its small size, it is feature packed with a responsive 11.6&Prime; touchscreen and upgraded components like its CPU, RAM and storage. With 3 years of warranty and insurance coverage, it offers superb value for money and will provide students with many good years of learning and productivity.</p>
