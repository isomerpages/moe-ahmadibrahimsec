<p>AI has nurtured many generations of alumni over our 54 years of rich history. In AI, we welcome our alumni back through alumni tea and networking sessions, to strengthen their bonds with the school and nurture synergistic partnerships.</p>
<p>AI alumni are established in respective fields and provide a broad network with which to enhance school life, such as offering work attachments to our students or returning to give talks. AI alumni provide strong support in key areas such as co-curricular activities, Education and Career Guidance, and the Work Experience Module.</p>
<p>We are proud of our alumni, and maintain a growing list of alumni achievements on our school website.</p>
<p>We also organise activities to bring alumni together, such as networking brunches or dinners. Alumni are also welcome to join us for various key school events such as the AI Sports Carnival, or Achievement Day.</p>
<p>We encourage our alumni to be actively involved and contributing role models, so as to meaningfully enhance school life for our AI students.</p>
