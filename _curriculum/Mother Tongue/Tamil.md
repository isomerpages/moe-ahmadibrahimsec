<p><strong>On line Story telling competition (2020)</strong></p>
<p>It was a great opportunity indeed, for Tamil students when my Tamil teacher Mr Perumal sent us a message, encouraging us to participate in a short story telling competition organized by Association of Singapore Tamil Writers during the COVID-19 period. I took up that challenge and did my best. I wrote the story and narrated. It was a splendid opportunity competing with fellow students all over Singapore. Though it was challenging, I had an experience participating in a competition online for the every first time! Here is the link for one of our videos.</p>

<p><strong>Translation Competition (2020)</strong></p>
<p>Being bilingual is crucial for students in Singapore, in order to compete in the outside world and be the best among the others. It is an advantage to know more than one language. We the secondary three students took part in a Translating Competition organized by the Singapore Tamil Association on 11 January 2020 at Singapore National Library. This competition also enhanced our bilingual skills. It was heartening and an encouragement to us to receive certificates of participation.</p>
<p>The translation competition was a very fruitful experience to me as I could practice my translation skills. The competing atmosphere gave me confidence and focus on task given. It was great to have a different outlook on tamil compositions too, as translation is not very widely used in classroom teaching as we are supposed to speak only in tamil during our tamil lessons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the experience was something very new and enjoyable for me.</p>

As food is the &lsquo;spice&rsquo; of life, the competition literally involved identifying spices used in everyday cooking.</p>
<p>The students were challenged to translate recipes, solve spice-related riddles, and identify Indian spices from the given Tamil names. In another part of the competition, students had to pick out the correct spices from a given shopping list.</p>
<p>Our students competed with 14 other schools in the competition organised by the &lsquo;Valar Thamizh Iyakkam&rsquo; (Tamil Language Council) and clinched the Second Position!</p>
