<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight</strong></h4>
<p>MTL Fortnight Unleashes Tamil's Vibrant Heritage</p>
<p>The Tamil Language Unit proudly presents a dynamic series of activities
that showcase the richness and beauty of the Tamil language. Students immerse
themselves in captivating cultural experiences, including the traditional
dance Oyilattam and Paraiattam performances. The drum called Parai is one
of the oldest symbols in Tamil culture.&nbsp; It consists of a circular
wooden frame with one end closed with cow skin membrane and the other end
open. Together with Parai, students also learnt the history and the cultural
aspect of the various types of Indian percussion instruments.</p>
<p>In a modern twist, students explore Artificial Intelligence in Tamil,
harnessing the power of GenAI to generate stunning images and craft engaging
Comic Books. By delving into the world of comics and their distinctive
features, students bring their creativity to life.</p>
<p>These innovative programmes empower students to appreciate Tamil as a
living, breathing heritage that transcends language barriers. The TL Unit's
efforts inspire students to cherish and celebrate their cultural roots,
fostering a deeper connection with the Tamil language and its timeless
legacy.</p>
