<h4><strong>Secondary 2 Learning Journey to the National Museum of Singapore</strong></h4>
<p>On 7 February 2025, our Secondary 2 cohort embarked on a meaningful learning
journey to the National Museum of Singapore, participating in the Museum-based
Learning Programme, "Artefactually Speaking." This visit aimed to deepen
students’ understanding of Singapore’s rich history while fostering a stronger
sense of national identity and citizenship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the programme, students explored artefacts spanning 700 years of
Singapore’s history and engaged in insightful discussions with Museum Educators.
They had the freedom to select artefacts of interest, interact with their
peers, and uncover the stories behind these historical pieces. Through
these interactions, they gained a deeper appreciation of how individuals
and communities in Singapore’s past forged connections with one another
and with the places they called home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Singapore’s oldest museum — founded in 1887 as the Raffles Museum and
Library — the National Museum of Singapore continues to inspire with its
exhibitions and programmes. This enriching experience provided our students
with valuable perspectives on our nation’s history, reinforcing the importance
of heritage and identity in shaping our collective future.</p>

<h3>Values In Action Programme</h3>
<p>Naming after a pioneer leader in Singapore’s nation-building years – Encik
Ahmad Ibrahim, service learning means a lot to us in AI because we are
named after him. This makes AI unique and community day serves as a reminder
and an inspiration for us to emulate his qualities of determination, courage,
integrity, and service.</p>

<p>2 previous years of global pandemic did not stop AI from contributing
back to the society as all classes were able to leverage technology to
circumvent the restrictions. This year 2022, AI has the privilege to either
held it virtually or the traditionally in-person physical volunteer events.</p>

<p>In AI, community service is not about one-off projects that can be done
in a day and checked off a to-do list. It required the sustained effort
of both teachers and students working in collaboration with organizations,
targeting at the needs of the community. As a result, valuable learning
and experience gained when all classes take pride in the community work
that they were doing, and were determined to do their part through meaningful
contributions to give back to the communities that we live, study and work
in.</p>

<p>This year, volunteerism is still going strong on virtual platforms in
AI, with activities like online Bingo games and Zumba classes being used
to engage and befriend elderly. Some classes even made videos of their
performance for the elderly. It does not stop at virtual sessions as some
classes also send presents to the elderly home, such as board games, masks,
and food.</p>

<p>Engaging in community service provides AI students with the opportunity
to become active members of their community and has a lasting, positive
impact on society at large. It also enables students to acquire life skills
and knowledge, as well as provide a service to those who need it most.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to witness the school spirit which is hope in action
- the heartbeat of the school! It is having such high school spirit that
AI students learn, lead, and grow.</p>
<p><strong><u>Students’ reflection</u></strong>
<br><em>My class community day allowed for intensive ideation where my classmates could brain-storm plausible ideas to help the elderlies in Singapore, our sunny island where our aging population is growing immensely. We formed groups and visualised our projects together, where we all collaborated with one another which I believed helped to unite the class. All in all, from the community day, we grew as individuals who care and have the greater initiative to help.</em>
<br>~&nbsp;<strong>Bellelyn Ong from class 3E2</strong>
</p>
<p><em>During these pandemic times, doing our VIA project was facile as the restrictive measures kept easing up. We managed to make a fool proof plan which we could go along without having to make many changes. In the making of the plan, I got to work closely with my classmates having to have that class bond while at the same time contributing to the community. It was a monumental experience for me and my class.</em>
