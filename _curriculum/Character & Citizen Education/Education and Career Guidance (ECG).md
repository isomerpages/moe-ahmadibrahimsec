<p>The <strong>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</strong> team organized
a series of engaging activities throughout the year to help students explore
future careers and post-secondary options aligned with Singaporeâ€™s economic
needs. The Secondary 2 ECG Program focuses on career readiness, guiding
students to reflect on their strengths, interests, and abilities, laying
the foundation for informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Through immersive experiences like the visit to ExxonMobil, students are
introduced to the world of STEM careers, discovering the role of photochemistry
in daily life. These real-world connections help students see how their
studies apply outside the classroom.</p>
<p>Students also participated in high-level competitions such as the AeroBot
Challenge and the Marvel of Science &amp; Tech Hackathon, where they applied
design thinking, refined problem-solving skills, and presented innovative
ideas to expert panels. These experiences help students gain clarity on
potential career paths while reinforcing the value of perseverance and
creativity.</p>
<p>Overall, the ECG programs empower students to dream big, aim high, and
understand that with determination, a world of opportunities awaits.</p>
