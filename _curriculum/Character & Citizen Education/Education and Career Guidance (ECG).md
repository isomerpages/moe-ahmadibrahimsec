<h4>AISS In-house Interview skills Workshops for EAE ITE, EAE Poly and DSA</h4>
<p>In May, students signed up for the interview skills workshop conducted
by the ECG Team. Apart from interview tips which include active listening
and answering the questions with confidence and yet with humility, tips
on how to carry themselves and how to position the camera were shared so
that students can portray themselves in the best light.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h4>e-PSOE for Sec 4 students</h4>
<p>In May, the graduating students were also given protected time to explore
post-secondary options. They learnt more about each course and its cut-off-points
(COP) based on the previous year’s admission exercise. Referring to their
mid-year results, students came to appreciate the gap between their current
performance and the COP of their desired course, prompting them to put
in more effort for the national examinations.</p>
<h4>Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) Course Talks for Sec 3 students</h4>
<p>In October, course talks that cut across different courses and polytechnics
and ITE were organised for Sec 3 students as part of the AI learning Fiesta.

in different polytechnics, especially courses that they did not even know
existed.&nbsp; Insights drawn from these talks provided students with a
desired course which they would work towards for next year.</p>

for ECG Counselling which allowed them to start thinking and plan where
they want to go upon graduation. Students were also more motivated to study.</p>
