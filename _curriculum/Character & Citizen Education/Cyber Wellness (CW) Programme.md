<h2>Cyber Wellness (CW) Programme</h2>
<p>Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of internet users. It
involves an understanding of the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour
with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber
world. It looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being
of students in their use of mobile and internet technologies.</p>

Cyber Wellness, the aim of the Cyber Wellness programme at AI is to develop
AI students into discerning and responsible ICT users who are able to protect
themselves and be responsible for their well- being in the cyberspace.</p>

lessons in CCE is important as it focuses on the well-being of our students
