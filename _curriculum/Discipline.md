<h2><strong><u>Student Management</u></strong></h2>
<h4><strong><u>Belief of Student Management in AISS</u></strong></h4>
<p>Our student management believes every student deserves to learn in a safe
and supportive environment, and we must foster a growth-oriented atmosphere
that empowers students to lead with empathy and drive positive change in
their communities.</p>
<p>We believe that every AISS learner has the capacity to develop self-discipline
and good character as they grow into Learners with Character. Through upholding
high expectations and providing consistent guidance and support, they will
cultivate sound values that define true character.</p>
<p>For every choice of action, there is a consequence. We also believe that
students should take ownership of their decisions as they develop into
Leaders with Heart, learning from their mistakes with compassion and support
from AISS staff. This ownership builds the responsible leadership qualities
needed to lead with empathy and wisdom.</p>
<p>It is the mission of every AISS staff to instill in our students discipline
and values. The Student Management Committee will support and work with
all staff to nurture our students as Champions of Change, empowering them
to become positive agents of transformation who can make meaningful contributions
to their communities and beyond.</p>
<h4><strong><u>An Overview of Serious and Minor Offences, and Baseline Disciplinary Consequences in AISS</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;An offence is considered <strong>serious </strong>when a student:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; causes serious harm and/or disruption to self, whether physical,
psychological or social; and/or</p>
<p>• causes serious harm and/or disruption to others, whether physical, psychological
or social; and/or</p>
<p>• causes serious damage to property or resources; and/or</p>
<p>• shows defiance against authorities.</p>
<p>For <strong>serious </strong>offences which also involve a breach of the
law (e.g., Substance Abuse, Vaping, Theft, Possession of weapons, Scams
and Frauds), schools will report the offence to the relevant law enforcement
agencies (LEAs) promptly. For such cases, schools will mete out school-based
consequences, in addition to the consequences meted out by the authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Very serious</strong> offences include Drug Abuse, Vaping (with
etomidate), Sexual Misconduct, Assault, Fighting, Gangsterism, Severe bullying
and other illegal/criminal offences under s424 or offences which result
in grievous hurt.</p>
<p>Examples of very serious (egregious) and serious offences:</p>
<p>Substance Abuse, Vaping, Vaping (Etomidate), Pornography, Leaving school
grounds without permission, Truancy, Assault, Bullying, Fighting, Gangsterism,
Sexual Misconduct</p>
<p>Arson, Cybersecurity Violations, Trespassing, Vandalism</p>
<p>Open Defiance to School Leaders/Teachers/Staff.</p>
<p><strong>Minor</strong> offences in school refer to behaviours that disrupt
learning, affect school discipline, or show a lack of responsibility. While
these offences may not be severe, they are taken seriously as they impact
the learning environment and the well-being of the school community.</p>
<p>Examples of minor offences:</p>
<p>Latecoming, Skipping classes, Negligent Damage of Property, Playful/uncooperative
behaviour, Online misconduct, Improper attire and grooming.</p>
<p>If the student commits multiple minor offences despite warnings/reminders,
it could also be reported as “Open Defiance” under Serious Offence.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Zero Tolerance Policy against Bullying in AISS</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;Bullying is a repeated pattern of behaviour where a student or group
intentionally targets others to cause distress. It can be cyber, physical,
social/relational or verbal in nature.</p>
<p>In AISS, we believe that every student has the right to learn in a safe
and supportive environment. Our school is committed to being a place where
all individuals can grow and develop without fear of bullying or harassment.
To uphold this, AISS will not hesitate to take firm and appropriate disciplinary
action against any form of bullying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>Reporting of Offences / Incidents</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Offences/incidents can be reported by any member of the school community(e.g.,
student, parent, school staff). When submitting a report, please include
the type of offence/incident, the identity of the student(s) involved,
and a clear description of the incident, including the date, time, location,
and what happened. Where applicable, provide the names of any witnesses
and the identity of the reporting person. Any other relevant information
that may help the school understand the situation should also be included,
along with photos or supporting evidence if available.</p>
<p><strong><u>Response Time Guidelines</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school commits to the following response time guidelines:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 working days: Acknowledge all feedback
and reply to straightforward enquiries.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 working days: For cases needing investigation,
including gathering statements and reviewing evidence.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21 working days: For complex cases involving
detailed investigations, multiple parties, or external agencies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Vaping enforcement</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Electronic vaporisers, also known as e-cigarettes, e-vaporisers or vapes,
are electronic devices that vaporise a liquid solution (e-liquid) to be
inhaled.</p>
<p>Health Sciences Authority's Tobacco Regulation Branch administers and
enforces the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act (TCASA).
From 1 February 2018, the purchase, possession, and use of emerging and
imitation tobacco products, which include e-vaporisers, have been prohibited.
This is in addition to earlier prohibitions on the importation, sale, and
distribution of these products.</p>
<p>From 1 September 2025, etomidate and its analogues will be classified
as Class C controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 (MDA) for
six months, pending introduction of more fit-for-purpose legislation.</p>
<p>For such cases, schools will mete out school-based consequences, <strong><u>in addition</u></strong> to
the consequences meted out by the authorities.</p>
