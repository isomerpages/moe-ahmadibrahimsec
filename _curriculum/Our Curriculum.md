<p>Our Total Curriculum aims to develop our students into future-ready digital
learners with an inquiring and disciplined mind. This ensures that our
students will continue to thrive and flourish as they transit to post-secondary
education and adulthood. To achieve this, our teachers seek to understand
and support effective classroom practices that can foster student motivation,
learning and achievement as we understood that the classroom teaching practices
play a significant role for student learning. We take guidance from the
Singapore Teaching Practice and adapt our teaching processes to support
our studentsâ€™ learning needs.</p>
