## Full Subject Based Banding
Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School is one of the secondary schools which will implement Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2023.

**Purpose of Full SBB**  
  
Full SBB is part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  
  
With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognize the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them

#### FSBB at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School in 2023

| **Aspect of FSBB** | **How will it be implemented?** |
|---|---|
| **Offering of Humanities at a more demanding level from Secondary Two** | Students will be able to offer Humanities subjects (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One. |
| **Aspect of FSBB** | **How will it be implemented?** |
| **Mixed form class with the provision of a common curriculum** | Students will be grouped into mixed form classes, with each form class comprising students taking different courses. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.<br>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.<br>These subjects are:<br>- Art<br>- Character and Citizenship Education<br>- Design and Technology<br>- Food and Consumer Education<br>- Music<br>- Physical Education<br><br>Teachers will adopt a range of teaching approaches to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.<br>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students' PSLE AL Score for each subject. |
