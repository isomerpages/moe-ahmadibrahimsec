<p><strong>&ldquo;Bahasa dijunjung, budaya disanjung&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Language learning and culture appreciation are two main foci that the Malay Language Unit strives to provide for the ML students in AI. We aspire to develop our students into proud and confident speaker of the Malay Language, individuals who love their mother tongue and appreciate their culture.</p>

<div>
<p>The Mother Tongue Cultural Day is an annual program which aims at bringing our students closer to their roots. Through culture appreciation we aim to enhance their knowledge and love of the mother tongue.<br /><br />The focus of our 2016 Malay Language Unit is traditional Malay music and theatre. Our Sec 1 students were introduced to kompang and dikir barat, two of the more popular traditional art form which are still popular among the local Malays today. The Sec 2 students, on the other hand, had an intriguing time with wayang kulit, a form of shadow puppetry which marries the art of storytelling, traditional music and shadow play.</p>
<p><strong>Silat</strong></p>

<p>Kicking and punching was the order of the day. It was not any ordinary day of course, as a group of students took to the stage to showcase &lsquo;silat&rsquo;, a form of martial arts indigenous to the Malay Archipelago. This year, our Secondary 2 Malay Language (ML) students were introduced to Silat during our Mother Tongue Cultural Day. Silat can be divided into two forms: a dancelike series of movements intended for public display, and a realistic combat method for sparring. Our students were exposed to both and were given opportunities to showcase their talent at the end of the programme.</p>
<p>As a follow-up to the programme, a select group of students had the chance to perform in front of the school during the Hari Raya Concert. Donning the full traditional attire, including the &lsquo;tanjak&rsquo; and &lsquo;kain samping&rsquo;, their showcase turned out to be one of the best performances of the day which was well received by the audience.</p>
<p>Tendang, tumbuk, tangkis, tepis! Begitulah sedikit sebanyak atur cara pada Hari Kebudayaan tahun ini bagi pelajar-pelajar Menengah 2. Seni silat memang sudah tidak asing lagi dalam kalangan masyarakat Melayu di Nusantara. Namun demikian, tidak ramai yang bertuah kerana berkesempatan melibatkan diri secara langsung dalam seni tersebut. Maka itulah, para pelajar dihidangkan dengan peluang untuk mengenali dengan lebih dekat lagi seni mempertahankan diri ini.</p>
<p>Sambutan para pelajar ternyata amat menggalakkan. Kesungguhan dan keseronokan jelas terpancar di wajah mereka yang sentiasa tekun meneliti dan menghayati setiap gerak langkah yang diajarkan. Apabila diberikan kesempatan untuk mempamerkan bakat masing-masing, tentulah disambut dengan amat ghairah sekali.</p>
<p>Bertitik tolak daripada aktiviti pengayaan tersebut, maka terlahirlah sebuah pertunjukan khas yang dipersembahkan oleh beberapa orang pelajar sempena perayaan Hari Raya pada tahun ini. Siap bertanjak dan bersamping, dipadankan pula dengan busana tradisional yang lengkap, tidak hairanlah pertunjukan mereka menerima sambutan yang sangat menggalakkan daripada penonton.</p>

<div>
<p>Earlier in the year, some of our 4N students had the chance to witness the production work of a local Malay TV drama. The behind-the-scene experience was indeed a very enriching one. To top it up, students were given the opportunity to mingle with and interview the TV stars.</p>

<p>The students came back and penned their experience down. Their writing was then submitted to i3 GenG, Berita Harian&rsquo;s students weekly publication.</p>
<p>The article written by Nuruljannah (4N1) and Muhd Faris (4N2) was published on 18 April 2016</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ML Cultural Trip to Pulau Langkawi<br /></strong><em>Planting Seeds of Love for the Malay Language and Culture in the Jewel Of Kedah</em></p>
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTDeltmgXIyW8VcXq14k3gPX2VnvjwLJrFJeWH_NmyhpzFB6rmKnvvw1nTyHUtBCqUbjgsmABdXlzwP/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<p>&ldquo;I am speechless! The paddy fields and the island view from this airplane&hellip; this sight is almost magical!&rdquo; quipped Harith Syafiq from 3N1, after our plane landed on Pulau Langkawi. Through the 5D4N trip, students were exposed to the rich cultural heritage of this island that was once a vassal of the ancient kingdom of Thailand.</p>
<p>At Laman Padi, a rice museum, students learnt how the very grains that they normally take for granted involves heavy toil in order to produce. At Mardi Agro Technology Park, a modern fruit farm, students were treated to a tram ride around the fruit plantation, and feasted on a buffet of local fruits. Students also forged new bonds when they interacted with their local peers from Sekolah Menengah Kampung Ayer Hangat, through a friendly match of traditional kampong games and a chit-chat session.</p>
<p>This trip planted seeds of change and nurtured love for the Malay language and culture in our students, opening windows of opportunities for them to widen their horizons.</p>
<p>Visit our students&rsquo; blogs at&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://aiss2018langkawi.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://aiss2018langkawi.weebly.com</a></strong>&nbsp;to view their experiences.</p>
<p><strong>ML Cultural Trip to Bandung</strong></p>
<p>Bandung, the flower city of West Java, Indonesia was the destination of our Malay Language Cultural Immersion Programme last year. The 5D4N programme from 30 October to 3 November 2016 aimed to provide students with various authentic learning experiences and endless opportunities for deeper learning. Throughout the 5 days, our students, with iPads in hand, were busy capturing and recording their learnings, engaging locals in interviews and documenting them in their blogs.</p>
<p>Favourites among the students were the trip to Tangkuban Perahu and SMKN 11 Bandung. Tangkuban Perahu offered the amazing panoramic scenery of the mountainous area surrounding Kawah Ratu (Queen&rsquo;s crater). The legend of Sangkuriang, a story behind the existence of Tangkuban Perahu itself was by itself also a great takeaway.</p>
<p>SMKN 11 Bandung, on the other hand, offered us their warm friendship, cultural learning experiences and opportunities for meaningful interactions. From the students there, our students learnt about traditional musical instruments, like the &lsquo;angklung&rsquo; and &lsquo;gamelan&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>BAHAS 4PM: MALAY DEBATE COMPETITION 2019</strong></p>
<p>On 23rd February 2019, 4 students from Sec 2 ML students represented AI in a debate competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their positivity radiates throughout the competition, not letting any challenges or their inexperience to hamper their belief that they are capable to be on par with the rest of the schools. Despite being one of the youngest group of students competing in this national competition, our students displayed great courage and perseverance in achieving their goals for this competition. They embraced the challenges confidently and understood the importance of working together to ensure that they are able to give their competitors a good fight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coupled with the experience that they have garnered from this competition as well as the qualities embodied in Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, next year would be yet another experience for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sekolah Menengah Ahmad Ibrahim,<br />Tidak akan menyerah kalah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Itulah LAUNGAN semangat pelajar AI sebelum mengorak langkah ke dewan perdebatan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tanggal 23 Februari merupakan percubaan AI dalam petandingan bahas 4PM setelah sekian lama menyepi. 4 pelajar dari menengah dua telah berganding bahu untuk memastikan mereka dapat memberikan perlawanan yang sengit terhadap kumpulan kumpulan yang handal dari merata Singapura. Walaupun pelajar AI mungkin belum lagi mantap dari segi persembahan dan pengolahan isi bebanding dengan sekolah- skolah yang lebih berpengalaman, sikap tidak berputus asa dan kekal berjuang kian membara dalam jiwa mereka. Yang penting, pengalaman yang diraih memang tiada tolok bandingnya. Tahun hadapan, berbekalkan dengan pengalaman yang baru diraih dan sikap Encik Ahmad Ibrahim yang terpahat dalam diri setiap pelajar, pasti kita akan berjuang sekali lagi!</p>

<p><strong><strong>NATIONAL SAHIBBA COMPETITION 2019</strong></strong></p>
<p>4 Sec 2 Malay Language students participated in the annual Sahibba Competition that was held in Woodgrove Secondary School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Reflection by students</p>
<p>&ldquo;North Zone Malay Language Scrabble Competition was held at Woodgrove Secondary School. This is the first time I took part in this competition. My experience at this competition was an enjoyable and a memorable one. I made new friends with other schools. We did not qualified to the next round. I will not give up and will practise hard for next year&rsquo;s competition&rdquo; &ndash; Farhan Aliff (2E1)</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the competition, I have learnt that there is always room for improvement and I will strive to do better next year&rdquo; &ndash; Noor Hakim (2E1)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This competition was so fun. It challenges my thinking and spelling skills. I made new friends and gained a lot from this experience. I was so hesitant to join this competition at first because I was too scared of competing against other schools. I am really thankful to be given this opportunity and I realise that learning Malay Language can be so much fun&rdquo; &ndash;Dinie Maisarah (2E4)</p>
