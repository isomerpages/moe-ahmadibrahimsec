<p><strong>Desired Outcomes of Aesthetics Education in AISS<br /></strong><br />The study of the Aesthetics in AISS helps to develop AI students into young ladies and gentlemen who appreciate beauty and the arts</p>

<li>Providing opportunities for recognition and grooming of artistic talents to be future artists and patrons of the arts; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cultivating in our students the sense of national and cultural identity.</li>
