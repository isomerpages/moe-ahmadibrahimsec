<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>Situated in a small room in the D&amp;T workshop area, the D&amp;T unit is a closely-knited group of dedicated teachers who are passionate about helping students to be more creative and independent in their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>D&amp;T students will gain a valuable skillset called &ldquo;Design Thinking&rdquo; at the end of their D&amp;T education. Such skillset will prove to be highly useful in a VUCA environment and will benefit the students in their tertiary education and working life in the future.</p>

<div>
<p>Through the use of well-designed projects that hinge on real-life context and technology, students are encouraged to become independent workers, critical thinkers, and life-long learners. Students are encouraged to take part in competitions, enrichment programmes and learning journeys to apply their knowledge learned during classroom lessons and reinforce their learning.</p>
<p><strong>Lower Secondary</strong></p>
<p>In lower secondary level, students learns to be innovative and darling designer from the start of Secondary education. Students learn through design-and-make projects guided by a design process of identifying design needs from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and realising the design solution. We also incorporated freehand sketching program to increase their confident of expressing their ideas through idea generation and development.</p>
<p><strong>Upper Secondary</strong></p>
<p>Upper secondary level cover technology topics in greater depth and focus on the application of technology in their design coursework. Student are involved in design process, learning how to do research, making sense of their research work and develop a prototype based on the findings to solve the identified problem. Students are taught advanced practical skills and SketchUp Programme.</p>
