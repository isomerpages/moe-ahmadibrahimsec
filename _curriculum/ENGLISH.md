<p>Make no mistake! This is not a choir practice but a session during this year&rsquo;s Public Speaking Workshop run by the renowned Julia Gabriel&nbsp;Speech and Drama Centre. Participants were given tips on how to carry themselves and how to speak off the cuff, a feat that is daunting to most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosted by the training, students put the skills they acquired to good use. They participated in public speaking competitions and were handpicked to host events in school.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<p>Few things strike fear into the hearts of students as unequivocally as these two words: public speaking. Hence, it is all the more commendable that 20 of our Secondary 1 to 3 students, identified through a stringent selection process, managed to successfully complete the Public Speaking Skills Programme conducted by Julia Gabriel Centre.</p>
<p>The purpose of this programme is to equip our students with emceeing and persuasive speaking skills which they can apply when giving presentations. All participants have been given opportunities to emcee for a variety of school events, ranging from formal occasions like Achievement Day to adrenaline pumping festivities like the National Day Celebration.</p>
<p>Besides participating in inter-school competitions like Chong Pang&rsquo;s Next Top Speaker, our public speaking students also took part in the annual AI Speech Competition. After a hard-fought Preliminary Round in which students had to give one-minute impromptu speeches, Shreya S Nair (1E2), Nurul Ailis Lee (1N1) and Loo Carol (3E1) emerged as the top three contestants and proceeded to the Final Round.</p>
<p>During the Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebration, the three girls spoke about gratitude for teachers, giving engaging and heartfelt speeches that moved the audience with their sincerity.</p>

<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Izwan%20Bin%20Indra_website.jpg" />
<p>Izwan Bin Indra (3E2) was declared 2018 Chong Pang's Next Top Speaker after battling with 8 other finalists. He exuded commanding stage presence and delivered his speech with conviction and flair. A pertinent speech (entitled Anti-social Social Network) wrapped in sincerity and adorned with a sprinkle of humour, it made us laugh, and it made us think. He also won the Crowd Favourite for Prepared Speech. Watch Izwan in action below.</p>

<p><strong><u>Winner of Unseen Poetry Debate at National Schools Literature Festival</u></strong></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Winner-of-Unseen-Poetry-Debate-at-National-Schools-Literature-Festival.jpg" />
<p>One may say it was beginner&rsquo;s luck that 4 students bagged a trophy in their maiden debate competition, but a stroke of luck it wasn&rsquo;t. With all the weeks of practice, mock debates with teachers, and video-calling to discuss and hone their arguments, these Pure Literature students from 4E3 demonstrated nothing less than pure grit and determination, scrutinising two poems in preparation for the Unseen Poetry Debate. New and inexperienced in debate they might have been, but won the praise of the judges they did for their close analysis. Winning despite being up against a debate-trained team from Evergreen Secondary School really gave these 4 young ladies a boost of confidence! Congratulations, Sarah, Sarefina, Serena and Chi Rou!</p>
<p>Winners<br />1. Sarah Tan Xin Hui 4E3<br />2. Sarefina Sindhu Victor 4E3<br />3. Yong Yi Xuan, Serena 4E3<br />4. Tay Chi Rou 4E3</p>
<p><strong><u>31st YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA)</u></strong></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/PESA%20Logo.png" />
<p>This year, total of four students from the Public Speaking Programme represented the school to take part in the&nbsp;<strong><em>31st Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA)</em></strong>, an annual public-speaking competition organised by the YMCA.<br />Lau Jiaxi (1E2) and Loke Xin Yue (2N1) participated in the Lower Secondary category, while Chan Jun Da Edward (3E4) and Nawal bte Muhammad Mustafah (3E4) took part in the Upper Secondary category.</p>

<p>In its second year of running, the Julia Gabriels Public Speaking Course aims to provide opportunities for interested students to hone their public speaking skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The course consisted of a series of workshops conducted across Semester 1, where students were taught pronunciation, speech development, voice projection and improvisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the programme, the participants were given opportunities to apply their public speaking skills in many school events and public speaking competitions. Students served as emcees in major events such as Achievement Day, and school celebrations such as Teachers&rsquo; Day and National Day. In addition, students also represented the school in public speaking competitions such as YMCA&rsquo;s Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) and Chong Pang&rsquo;s Next Top Speaker 2017.</p>
<p>It was a joy to witness these students grow as confident and persuasive communicators.</p>

<p><strong><u>The AISS Reading Programme</u></strong></p>
<p>AI has been on the Read@NLB Programme since January 2015.&nbsp;<br />The focus has been to encourage and promote reading among our Lower Secondary students.&nbsp;<br />We closely track the reading habits of our students and set specific targets for the year.</p>
<p><strong><u>Think Green Jamboree</u></strong></p>
<p>Think Green Jamboree was held in Term 2, on the 10th of April 2017, and it was on the theme of the Environment and Climate Change. The reading genres of Science Fiction, Dystopia and others were explored, with screenings of documentaries on the theme of Saving the Environment. There were live music performances where a band was assembled, that played melodious tunes, with lyrics that developed the concept of a better Green Environment. There was also a hands-on, craft-making station where students created their own pieces of Art using recycled paper and other discarded material which was quite therapeutic! There was also the opportunity for students to formulate their thoughts and speak on specific aspects of the theme, based on taglines they happened to draw. In addition, there were Book Displays and readings on the Environment &amp; our Animal Friends. Students and teachers alike enjoyed the creation and use of the photo-booth, made of recycled materials with props.</p>

<p><strong><u>Think Green Jamboree</u></strong></p>
<p>Held during the post-SA2 period, the October Jamboree &ndash; Spooktacular brought to students a series of activities and stories featuring the book genres of Horror and Thriller. One of the activities included a crime-scene investigation where students were challenged to solve a murder mystery at a staged crime scene. Students were also treated to a Movie Excerpt Screening to see how novels can come alive on screen. Excerpts of horror and thriller novels were read before the corresponding scenes of the same movies were screened. In addition, aspiring writers were encouraged to try their hand at writing two-sentence horror stories to scare their peers and teachers. Besides all these, students were also able to take photographs with their friends at the photo booth furnished with an array of masks and props. To top it all up, books written by acclaimed writers such as Stephen King and Dean Koontz were featured in an attention-grabbing book display that encouraged students to browse and borrow the books home.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>World Poetry Day</strong></span></p>
<p>Every year, on 21st March, the whole world celebrates all things poetry. This year, poetry has taken over AISS as the English and Literature department has planned a week-long series of activities to celebrate World Poetry Day.</p>
<img style="width: 75%;" src="/images/Students%20Poetry%20Display%20in%20the%20library.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Students&rsquo; Poetry Display in the library</strong></p>
<img style="width: 25%;" src="/images/Showcase%20of%20students%20poetry.jpg" align = "left" />
<p>The library showcased projects that were done by our Secondary 1 and 3 students. The Secondary 1 students designed album covers and created Instagram profiles to feature the main themes and characters of the two poetries they have learnt in class &ndash; &lsquo;On Turning Ten&rsquo; by Billy Collins and &lsquo;Tich Miller&rsquo; by Wendy Cope. The Secondary 3 students had a dramatic recital of the poems they were studying in class and recorded their recital in audio format. By scanning the QR code on display, AISS students got to listen to the recital performed by the students.</p>
<p>Another showcase was set up near the General Office and in front of the AI ARC. Our AI family was able to admire the good work of our Secondary 2 and 4 students who upcycled old library books by making inspirational blackout poetry from torn out pages.</p>

<p>"ContemplAtIons" is a yearly anthology of short stories, poems, other writings and illustrations produced by the student participants of the EL Department's Creative Writing Programme. From 2020, to do our part for the environment, we shifted from print copies to digital e-publications. This has allowed the students to share their wonderful pieces with a wider audience and created a space for readers to engage with our writers. This year, we have Insta-poetry, rap videos, twin cinemas, self-illustrated e-books and Choose-You-Own-Adventure stories. It&rsquo;s a fiesta!</p>
