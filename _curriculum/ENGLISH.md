<p>Make no mistake! This is not a choir practice but a session during this year&rsquo;s Public Speaking Workshop run by the renowned Julia Gabriel&nbsp;Speech and Drama Centre. Participants were given tips on how to carry themselves and how to speak off the cuff, a feat that is daunting to most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosted by the training, students put the skills they acquired to good use. They participated in public speaking competitions and were handpicked to host events in school.&nbsp;</p>
