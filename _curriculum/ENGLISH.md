<p>Make no mistake! This is not a choir practice but a session during this year&rsquo;s Public Speaking Workshop run by the renowned Julia Gabriel&nbsp;Speech and Drama Centre. Participants were given tips on how to carry themselves and how to speak off the cuff, a feat that is daunting to most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boosted by the training, students put the skills they acquired to good use. They participated in public speaking competitions and were handpicked to host events in school.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2019</strong></p>
<p>Few things strike fear into the hearts of students as unequivocally as these two words: public speaking. Hence, it is all the more commendable that 20 of our Secondary 1 to 3 students, identified through a stringent selection process, managed to successfully complete the Public Speaking Skills Programme conducted by Julia Gabriel Centre.</p>
<p>The purpose of this programme is to equip our students with emceeing and persuasive speaking skills which they can apply when giving presentations. All participants have been given opportunities to emcee for a variety of school events, ranging from formal occasions like Achievement Day to adrenaline pumping festivities like the National Day Celebration.</p>
<p>Besides participating in inter-school competitions like Chong Pang&rsquo;s Next Top Speaker, our public speaking students also took part in the annual AI Speech Competition. After a hard-fought Preliminary Round in which students had to give one-minute impromptu speeches, Shreya S Nair (1E2), Nurul Ailis Lee (1N1) and Loo Carol (3E1) emerged as the top three contestants and proceeded to the Final Round.</p>
<p>During the Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebration, the three girls spoke about gratitude for teachers, giving engaging and heartfelt speeches that moved the audience with their sincerity.</p>

<p>Izwan Bin Indra (3E2) was declared 2018 Chong Pang's Next Top Speaker after battling with 8 other finalists. He exuded commanding stage presence and delivered his speech with conviction and flair. A pertinent speech (entitled Anti-social Social Network) wrapped in sincerity and adorned with a sprinkle of humour, it made us laugh, and it made us think. He also won the Crowd Favourite for Prepared Speech. Watch Izwan in action below.</p>

<p><strong><u>Winner of Unseen Poetry Debate at National Schools Literature Festival</u></strong></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Winner-of-Unseen-Poetry-Debate-at-National-Schools-Literature-Festival.jpg" />
<p>One may say it was beginner&rsquo;s luck that 4 students bagged a trophy in their maiden debate competition, but a stroke of luck it wasn&rsquo;t. With all the weeks of practice, mock debates with teachers, and video-calling to discuss and hone their arguments, these Pure Literature students from 4E3 demonstrated nothing less than pure grit and determination, scrutinising two poems in preparation for the Unseen Poetry Debate. New and inexperienced in debate they might have been, but won the praise of the judges they did for their close analysis. Winning despite being up against a debate-trained team from Evergreen Secondary School really gave these 4 young ladies a boost of confidence! Congratulations, Sarah, Sarefina, Serena and Chi Rou!</p>
<p>Winners<br />1. Sarah Tan Xin Hui 4E3<br />2. Sarefina Sindhu Victor 4E3<br />3. Yong Yi Xuan, Serena 4E3<br />4. Tay Chi Rou 4E3</p>
