<p><strong>Mental Health (MH):</strong> Mental health is about having a balance
in various aspects of life, and learning values and social-emotional competencies
to cope with life’s situations, relate to others and contribute to the
community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A focus on MH in CCE at the secondary level helps students to strengthen
their resilience and wellbeing; differentiate between stress, distress
(overwhelming stress), and illness; enhance help-seeking efficacy; as well
