<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vision<br></strong>At AISS, we aim to nurture our students with the strength of character to care, lead and serve. </p>

<p><strong>Beliefs<br></strong>
We believe that<br>
• Every student can and should be developed as a leader.<br>
• Leadership can be developed over time.<br>
• Leadership development should be intentional.</p>

<p><strong>Our Approach<br></strong>
Our approach to student leadership development is undergirded by Kouzes and Posner’s Student Leadership Challenge model which encapsulates our beliefs and principles in developing the leadership competencies in AI students as they make a difference in their spheres of influence and lead in the different domains of service.</p>

<p>With a structured approach, we are intentional in developing our student leaders through various leadership opportunities and training. As AI students lead and serve the school and community, they apply what they have learnt, evaluate their leadership effectiveness and reflect on how they can sharpen their leadership competencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Leaders in AI</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Student Councillors<br></strong>As the apex of student leadership of the school, Student Councillors lead the way for the student body through role modelling. Undergoing leadership trainings and hands- on project management, the Student Council develops student leaders who lead and serve the school while upholding the school’s code of conduct.<br><br>
The Student Council aims to build a sense of family and add excitement and vibrancy to the students’ school life. The Student Councillors serve the interest of the students through the organisation and execution of school events and celebrations, including the Secondary One Orientation and Teachers Day Celebrations, where they are stretched to apply what they have learnt.<br><br>
Student Councillors also actively reach out to their peers to hear their concerns and appropriate actions will be taken to address issues raised, as Student Councillors are constantly seeking to work with the School in improving the AI School experience for the student population. </p>

<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders<br></strong>
Peer Support Leaders play an active role in the support for students’ mental well-being. They are guided by the Peer Support and Relationship Framework, which is shaped by three main areas: Peer Supporting, Peer Bonding and Peer Influencing.</p>

<p>Peer Support Leaders aims to<br>
• Provide emotional and physical support. <br>
• <strong><u>Create awareness</u></strong> on mental wellness, exam stress and other societal issues.<br>
• <strong><u>Engage the class</u></strong> through activities.<br>
• Ensure a <strong><u>conducive and positive classroom culture</u></strong> for all. <br></p>

<p>	Peer Support Leaders are involved in a number of events that cater to the socio-emotional well-being of the school and they undergo training to learn more advanced peer support skills such as befriending and bonding, managing challenging situations and self-management.</p>

<p><strong>Class Leaders<br></strong>
Class Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons work towards building a positive and conducive learning environment for their classmates. They help develop a sense of identity and belonging amongst their classmates and strengthen class spirit through class-initiated and school activities. Through training programmes, Class Leaders develop leadership skills which enable them to be proactive in building good rapport with their peers and meeting the needs of their classes.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Leaders<br></strong>
CCA leaders play a vital role in ensuring that CCA activities are well-organized, engaging, and inclusive for all AI students. CCA Leaders support their peers in CCA and help forge meaningful relationships while learning how to overcome challenges and undertake decision making skills. They work closely with their CCA teachers to plan and execute events, and are also responsible for mentoring and training younger members of their CCA, helping to create a culture of camaraderie and excellence.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Leaders<br></strong>
Outdoor Leaders are the face of AISS’s Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) programme. It is a leadership programme that encourages students to develop the interest and skills to serve the school community in areas involving sports and the outdoors. Outdoor Leaders are given the opportunity to develop qualities of leadership and responsibility and demonstrate decision-making skills by leading other students in sports and recreational activities. They epitomize the outdoor spirit in striving for excellence and rising to challenges.</p>
