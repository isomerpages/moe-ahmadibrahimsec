<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vision<br></strong>At AISS, we aim to nurture our students with the strength of character to care, lead and serve. </p>

<p><strong>Beliefs<br></strong>
We believe that<br>
• Every student can and should be developed as a leader.<br>
• Leadership can be developed over time.<br>
• Leadership development should be intentional..</p>

<p><strong>Our Approach<br></strong>
Our approach to student leadership development is undergirded by Kouzes and Posner’s Student Leadership Challenge model which encapsulates our beliefs and principles in developing the leadership competencies in AI students as they make a difference in their spheres of influence and lead in the different domains of service.</p>

<p>With a structured approach, we are intentional in developing our student leaders through various leadership opportunities and training. As AI students lead and serve the school and community, they apply what they have learnt, evaluate their leadership effectiveness and reflect on how they can sharpen their leadership competencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Leaders in AI</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Student Councillors<br></strong>As the apex of student leadership of the school, Student Councillors lead the way for the student body through role modelling. Undergoing leadership trainings and hands- on project management, the Student Council develops student leaders who lead and serve the school while upholding the school’s code of conduct.<br><br>
The Student Council aims to build a sense of family and add excitement and vibrancy to the students’ school life. The Student Councillors serve the interest of the students through the organisation and execution of school events and celebrations, including the Secondary One Orientation and Teachers Day Celebrations, where they are stretched to apply what they have learnt.<br><br>
Student Councillors also actively reach out to their peers to hear their concerns and appropriate actions will be taken to address issues raised, as Student Councillors are constantly seeking to work with the School in improving the AI School experience for the student population. </p>

<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders<br></strong>Peer Support Leaders look out for their peers and provide practical help and socio-emotional support for them. They undergo training to learn more advanced peer support skills such as befriending and bonding, managing challenging situations and self-management.</p>
<p><strong>Class Leaders<br></strong>Class Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson oversee the smooth running of class processes and develop sense of identity to class and build class spirit through class-initiated and school activities.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor Leaders<br></strong>Outdoor Leaders are the face of AISS’s Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) programme. They epitomise the outdoor spirit in striving for excellence and rising to challenges. They also spread the love for the outdoors when they lead their juniors during OLE2.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Leaders<br></strong>CCA Leaders are selected to lead in different roles within their Co-curricular Activities in the planning and execution of meetings, camps and other activities.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 1 Orientation Programme<br></strong>The Student Leaders ease new Secondary 1 students into the new secondary school environment in AI through the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme. Through games and other team-bonding activities, the student leaders provide a good overview about the history of AI, the school culture and norms, and also helped to build class spirit and school spirit in the new batch of students. The student leaders also serve as role models by exemplifying our school values to these new students.</p>

<p><strong>Quote of the week and Ordinary Miracles sharing<br></strong>Through the termly sharing of ‘Ordinary Miracles in AI’ by Student Councillors, both students and staff of AI learn about things happening in the school that are meaningful yet often overlooked. This promotes a sense of gratitude in both staff and students and increases the awareness of the many positive aspects of school life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weekly sharing of a ‘Quote of the Week’ by Student Councillors, encourages students to display our school values, by relating one of our school values with current school events or activities.</p>

<p><strong>Student feedback and school improvement projects<br></strong>The Student Council serves as a channel between the student body and the school management. Working closely with the Class Leaders, the Student Councillors gather feedback from the student body. They consider multiple perspectives and differing viewpoints before organising the feedback obtained and presenting them to the School Principal at a dialogue session. This Student Voice Project has led to actual school improvement initiatives and has built student leaders who have greater sensitivity to areas of concerns of their peers and the school. The success of the project motivated the Student Council to continue to find new ways to engage the student body in improving their secondary school experience.</p>

<p><strong>Teachers’ Day Celebration<br></strong>As individuals who are innovative and enthusiastic, the Student Councillors also continually challenge themselves in generating new ideas in the implementation of major school events such as the annual Teachers’ Day celebrations. With the help of other student leader groups, the Student Councillors work hard to coordinate class appreciation activities and a memorable concert for their teachers on Teachers’ Day.</p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Image%209_Teachers%20Day.jpg">
<p><strong>Service Learning workshops and service learning at VWOs<br></strong>The Student Councillors are involved in a Service Learning workshop each year, where they learn about community needs and the design thinking process behind the planning of a service learning project. These workshops lead to a student-planned service learning project to serve selected Volunteer Welfare Organisations such as SWAMI Home, Lions Befrienders and MINDS.</p>
<img src="/images/sl2.png">
<p><strong>External workshops and leadership convention</strong><br>Beyond their involvement within the school, representatives from the Student Council also take part in external workshops and leadership convention (e.g. Chong Pang Youth Communication and Leadership workshop and Hwa Chong Student Leader Convention). These students learn and interact with student leaders of other schools and improve on their leadership skills, before consolidating their learning and sharing what they learn with their peers in school.</p>
