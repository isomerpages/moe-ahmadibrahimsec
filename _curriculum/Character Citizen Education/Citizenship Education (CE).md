## Citizenship Education (CE)
#### National Day Celebration
In 2022 National Day, we celebrated how strong all of us have been together. This year’s theme, “Stronger Together, Majulah!”, is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future.  
  
This year’s National Day celebration consisted of a hybrid format incorporating a Zoom and Hall performance. Leading up to the celebration, our students’ creativity was put to the test in the Class National Day Class Notice Board Competition.  
  
Our students continued to amaze us by regaling the school with their fantastic costume display in the Fancy Dress competition.  
  
Our celebration was made even more memorable with a performance by Our Chinese Orchestra with two musical pieces entitled “Rasa Sayang” and “Nan’er Dang Zi Qiang - A Man of Determination”.  
  
The celebration ended off with the school singing their hearts out to National Day Songs in a community singing activity.

#### Racial Harmony Day Celebration
Racial Harmony Day is a day where Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity is valued and appreciated and where social cohesion and harmony is promoted.  
  
This year, our theme for Racial Harmony Day is “Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic” where we had a very special performance by our school’s Chinese Orchestra. Our Chinese Orchestra showed us why it is necessary for joy and harmony to prevail with a piece arranged by Ace Teo and Isaac Lee of 4E3 entitled “Final Fantasy XIV”.  
  
Our dance also dazzled us with a performance, “Turning Chaos into Order”, highlighting how each community, while having the space to express its own identity as part of Singapore society, also intertwines with others to depict the unique cultural diversity that characterizes Singapore life.  
  
The teachers from the Humanities department put our students and teachers to the test with their very own quiz segment! The quiz tests students’ knowledge on current affairs around the world, focusing on the consequences of discrimination in different parts of the world.  
  
Students were reminded on how social cohesion in Singapore is always a work in progress and how everyone has an important part to play in ensuring social cohesion and harmony.
