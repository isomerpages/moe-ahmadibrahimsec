<h2>Citizenship Education (CE)</h2>
<p>CCE is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn
values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship
dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.</p>
<p>In AI, we value the holistic development of every student. The school
has implemented the CCE curriculum to anchor AI students on a strong foundation
of moral values, good character and resilience. This is in alignment to
our mission to grow students with strength of character, nurture inquiring
and disciplined minds and inspiring them with courage to lead and serve.
We will also encourage AI students to play a more active role as citizens
of Singapore as they care, learn and excel for AI and for the nation.</p>
