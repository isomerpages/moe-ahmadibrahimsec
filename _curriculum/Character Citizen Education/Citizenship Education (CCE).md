<h2>Citizenship Education (CCE)</h2>
<p>CCE is at the heart of education in Singapore. Through CCE, students learn
values, social-emotional competencies, and develop character and citizenship
dispositions that enable them to grow holistically and learn for life.</p>
<p>In AI, we value the holistic development of every student. The school
has implemented the CCE curriculum to anchor AI students on a strong foundation
of moral values, good character and resilience. This is in alignment to
our mission to grow students with strength of character, nurture inquiring
and disciplined minds and inspiring them with courage to lead and serve.
We will also encourage AI students to play a more active role as citizens
of Singapore as they care, learn and excel for AI and for the nation.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>CCE 2021 aims to inculcate AI students with <strong>good character</strong> who
have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong. The AI
student will be able to think critically and ethically, be discerning in
judgment and take responsibility for his/her own choices and actions.</p>
<p>Students will also demonstrate <strong>resilience </strong>when faced with
challenges and enhance their <strong>social- emotional well-being </strong>through
a balanced sense of self and healthy relationships with their peers.</p>
<p>In addition, AI will promote <strong>active citizenship </strong>based
on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and
the future, an awareness of the reality of Singaporeâ€™s vulnerabilities
and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others,
and building a future for our nation.</p>
<p>Lastly, we aim to prepare AI students to be <strong>future ready </strong>by
developing the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so students
will be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and
take on the challenges of the future. There are several learning platforms
where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during
curriculum time, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the
classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject
lessons, and learning opportunities beyond school.</p>
