## About Us


We believe that visual impairment is not a hindrance but a challenge. With training, support and guidance, visually impaired (VI) students can achieve academic success and develop strength of character to meet life’s challenges.

  

The Integration Programme for the Visually impaired (IPVI) is a measure to provide secondary education for VI students in a mainstream school. Implemented in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary school (AISS) in 1967, the school continues to be committed to the education of VI students today.

  

AISS adopts a fully concerted approach to provide the opportunities, facilities and support to ensure VI students receive a holistic education that enables them to achieve academic success and develop strength of character.
