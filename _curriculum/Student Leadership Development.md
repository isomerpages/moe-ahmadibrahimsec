<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Vision<br></strong>At AISS, we aim to nurture our students with
the strength of character to care, lead and serve.</p>
<p><strong>Beliefs<br></strong>We believe that
<br>• Every student can and should be developed as a leader.
<br>• Leadership can be developed over time.
<br>• Leadership development should be intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach<br></strong>Our approach to student leadership development
is undergirded by Kouzes and Posner’s Student Leadership Challenge model
which encapsulates our beliefs and principles in developing the leadership
competencies in AI students. The AISS Student Leadership Framework exemplifies
the desired student outcomes, where a student leader in AI is a positive
agent of change; is proactive and possesses adaptive, critical and inventive
thinking; a confident communicator who empathizes and in so doing, better
serves the community.</p>

<p><strong>AISS Student Leadership Framework</strong>
<br>With a structured approach, we are intentional in developing our student
leaders through various leadership opportunities and training. As AI students
lead and serve the school and community, they apply what they have learnt,
evaluate their leadership effectiveness and reflect on how they can sharpen
their leadership competencies.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Leaders in AI</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Student Councillors<br></strong>As the apex of student leadership
of the school, Student Councillors lead the way for the student body through
role modelling. Undergoing leadership trainings and hands- on project management,
the Student Council develops student leaders who lead and serve the school
while upholding the school’s code of conduct.
<br>
<br>The Student Council aims to build a sense of family and add excitement
and vibrancy to the students’ school life. The Student Councillors serve
the interest of the students through the organisation and execution of
school events and celebrations, including the Secondary One Orientation
and Teachers Day Celebrations, where they are stretched to apply what they
have learnt.
<br>
<br>Student Councillors also actively reach out to their peers to hear their
concerns and appropriate actions will be taken to address issues raised,
as Student Councillors are constantly seeking to work with the School in
improving the AI School experience for the student population.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Support Leaders<br></strong>Peer Support Leaders play an
active role in the support for students’ mental well-being. They are guided
by the Peer Support and Relationship Framework, which is shaped by three
main areas: Peer Supporting, Peer Bonding and Peer Influencing.</p>
<p>Peer Support Leaders aims to
<br>• Provide emotional and physical support.
<br>• <strong><u>Create awareness</u></strong> on mental wellness, exam stress
and other societal issues.
<br>• <strong><u>Engage the class</u></strong> through activities.
<br>• Ensure a <strong><u>conducive and positive classroom culture</u></strong> for
all.
<br>
</p>
<p>Peer Support Leaders are involved in a number of events that cater to
the socio-emotional well-being of the school and they undergo training
to learn more advanced peer support skills such as befriending and bonding,
managing challenging situations and self-management.</p>
<p><strong>Class Leaders<br></strong>Class Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons
work towards building a positive and conducive learning environment for
their classmates. They help develop a sense of identity and belonging amongst
their classmates and strengthen class spirit through class-initiated and
school activities. Through training programmes, Class Leaders develop leadership
skills which enable them to be proactive in building good rapport with
their peers and meeting the needs of their classes.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Leaders<br></strong>CCA leaders play a vital role in ensuring
that CCA activities are well-organized, engaging, and inclusive for all
AI students. CCA Leaders support their peers in CCA and help forge meaningful
relationships while learning how to overcome challenges and undertake decision
making skills. They work closely with their CCA teachers to plan and execute
events, and are also responsible for mentoring and training younger members
of their CCA, helping to create a culture of camaraderie and excellence.</p>
<p><strong>Outdoor Leaders<br></strong>Outdoor Leaders are the face of AISS’s
Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) programme. It is a leadership programme
that encourages students to develop the interest and skills to serve the
school community in areas involving sports and the outdoors. Outdoor Leaders
are given the opportunity to develop qualities of leadership and responsibility
and demonstrate decision-making skills by leading other students in sports
and recreational activities. They epitomize the outdoor spirit in striving
for excellence and rising to challenges.</p>
