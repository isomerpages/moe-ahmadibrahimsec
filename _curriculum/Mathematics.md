<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<strong>Department Vision</strong><br>

Every AI student, a future-ready and critical thinker with a passion for Mathematics

  

<strong>Department Mission</strong><br>

To nurture students to be confident and inquisitive problem solvers

  

<strong>Department Philosophy</strong><br>

<p>We believe every student can do Mathematics and that a strong foundation in the discipline will benefit them in the future. We strive to develop students’ conceptual understanding, cognitive and metacognitive skills, as well as inspire in our students an appreciation of the beauty and relevance of Mathematics. Through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, we want our students to be curious about the world around them, think creatively and critically in solving real-world problems.</p>

	<p><strong>1. National Digital Literacy Programme</strong></p>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Teachers are guided by e-Pedagogy to design learning experiences with their personalised learning devices that enable students to acquire and develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions as future-ready learners. In the Mathematics classrooms, technology is leveraged to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all students, to foster conceptual change as well as support assessment for learning.</p><br>

<p><strong>2. Code for Fun Programme</strong></p>
	<p>Our Secondary 1 students were treated to the ‘Code For Fun’ programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) that exposed them to computational thinking which refers to the ability to use four skills: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation and algorithmic thinking in solving problems.</p><br>


<p>Students first learnt the basics of block-based programming and applied the use of a microcontroller, sensors and coding to facilitate daily activities. As part of the programme, students were engaged in a group task that required them to create simulations to solve real-world problems. For example, one of the teams created a smart fan control system to save energy in the house using the Boson Starter Kit. Through the group task, students acquired and applied concepts of design thinking as well as solved real-world problems with the mathematics and science concepts learnt in the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>3. Math Alive!</strong></p>
<p>Conducted as part of post-exam activities on 25 May and 26 May for Sec 1 and 2 students respectively, students experienced part of the mathematical modelling process through the process of solving the problems in the Math Alive! Programme.</p><br>

<p>The Sec 1 students estimated the maximum number of $1 coins that can be laid in a particular assigned venue, which led to some innovative ways to estimate the variables necessary for them to come up with this maximum number. The Sec 2 students were tasked to investigate if the new strawless lid from Starbucks uses more plastic than the old lid design. This context presents an opportunity to raise awareness about carbon footprint, waste management and sustainability agenda under the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><br>

<p>Through the process, students learnt to formulate the problem, make sense of and discuss data, select and apply appropriate concepts and skills to solve the problems and interpret the mathematical solutions in the context of the problem. Students also acquired STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) knowledge and skills through solving these problems in real world contexts.</p>

<p><strong>4. Lockdown Escape @ AISS</strong></p>
<p>Are you game enough to save the world? Our Secondary 1 students assumed the roles of superheroes as they solved Mathematics-related puzzles to unlock 6 Infinity Stones to fight the supervillain, Thanos, in the Lockdown Escape @AISS! This allowed students to solve higher-order thinking problems and build new knowledge in a fun and collaborative manner.</p><br>
	
<p>“I found the Lockdown Escape very exciting and fun! I learnt how to work as a team, think out of the box and persevere in solving all the Mathematics puzzles. I hope there are more chances to play the Lockdown Escape again!” quipped Jenson Heng, after the lockdown escape.</p><br>
	
<p>The students were thrilled by the Avengers Endgame storyline and the adrenaline rush of saving the world! We hope that through such learning experiences, we can help students to experience the joy of learning mathematics.</p><br>

<p><strong>1. International Mathematical Modeling Challenge</strong></p>
<p>“How can we create plane boarding and disembarking methods that will be the most time-effective in real practice?”</p><br>
<p>During the March holidays, a team of Secondary Four students worked collaboratively over a period of five days to solve the Boarding and Disembarking problem at the Annual International Mathematical Modeling Challenge, pitching against participants from other teams in Singapore.</p><br>
	
<p>The modeling process allowed the students to learn to deal with uncertainty as they needed to break the problem down into smaller parts and make reasonable assumptions. It also provided them with a first taste in problems of such nature they will be working on in the future where there is no one correct answer to the problem.</p><br>

<p><strong>2. STEM Playground Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Ready, get set, go! A team of Sec 2 students participated in the STEM Playground Challenge jointly organised by Singapore Science Centre and The James Dyson Foundation supported by MOE CPDD Science Branch. Through the challenge, our students had fun experimenting and learning STEM knowledge and skills through real-world contexts. #BeCurious #BeCreative #BeTheChange</p><br>

<p><strong>3. Singapore Mathematical Society Public Lecture 2022</strong></p>
<p>Probability and Combinatorics in School Mathematics by Professor Helmer Aslaksen</p><br>

<p>On 4 Aug, 2022 a group of students attended the Singapore Mathematical Society Public Lecture 2022 where Prof Helmer talked about interesting problems in probability and combinatorics. These are difficult topics in the school Mathematics curriculum, but our students were intrigued by the lecture on how incorrect arguments may look plausible and correct arguments may look surprising in these topics!</p><br>

<p><strong>4. ICAS Mathematics Competition</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, 30 of our Sec 1 students participated in the International Competitions and Assessments for Schools, Mathematics competition. The competition is designed to assess the students’ ability to apply classroom learning in new contexts, using higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills. Our students attained 5 Distinction, 15 Credit, 2 Merit and 8 Participation. We congratulate the winners on their outstanding achievements!</p><br>
