<h2>Mathematics</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>Every AI student, a future-ready and critical thinker with a passion for
Mathematics.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture students to be confident and inquisitive problem solvers through
quality instructional programme.</p>
<p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe every student has the potential to excel in Mathematics and
that a strong foundation in the discipline will be invaluable for the future.
We strive to develop students’ conceptual understanding, enhance cognitive
and metacognitive skills, as well as inspire in our students an appreciation
of the beauty and relevance of Mathematics. We aim to cultivate curiosity
about the world and develop students' abilities to think creatively and
critically when addressing real-world challenges. We aspire for our students
to apply and engage with Mathematics in ways that prepare them to be well-rounded,
logical, and analytical thinkers who can make informed decisions and actively
contribute to the evolving economy and society.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Lessons</strong>
</p>
<p>The central focus of the mathematics classroom is the development of mathematical
problem solving competency. Supporting this focus are five inter-related
components – concepts, skills, processes, metacognition and attitudes.</p>

<p>In the Mathematics classrooms, technology is also leveraged to differentiate
instruction to meet the needs of all students, foster conceptual change
as well as support assessment for learning.</p>

<br><strong><u>Code For Fun</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Code for Fun Programme aims to increase students’ exposure to computational
thinking and digital making and introduce them to the world of coding.
Through the 10-hour enrichment, our Secondary 1 students had the opportunity
to tinker with microcontrollers and the SMART AI World Kit to produce simple
prototypes that help to solve a real-life problem. The process allowed
the students to develop an appreciation of core computational thinking
and coding concepts, excited them about the opportunities in the digital
age and exposed them to the skill sets needed for the digital economy.&nbsp;</p>

<br><strong><u>Math Alive!</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Conducted as part of post-exam activities for the Secondary 1 to 3 students,
the Math Alive! series aims to allow students to see the real-world application
of Mathematics in their daily life.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, the lower secondary students had the opportunity to see how
Statistics is used everywhere in their daily life. They explored the various
data collection methods with their classmates based on problems given,
learnt various ways of representing data using ICT, and saw for themselves
how the way data is represented may mislead audiences. Students also had
the opportunity to present their findings to their classmates subsequently.
The enthusiasm shown during the session and the positive feedback received
after the session was heartening.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Secondary 3 students were tasked to investigate the applications of
3D trigonometry in their school environment. They learnt to make clinometers
using readily available materials and explored the concepts of angle of
elevation and depression around them. The session ended with them applying
the concepts and skills acquired in a bigger context – the aviation industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the respective sessions, students experienced part of the mathematical
modelling process when they formulate problems, select and apply appropriate
concepts and skills to solve the problems, and interpret the mathematical
solutions in the context of the problems.</p>

<p><strong><u>International Mathematical Modelling Challenge (Singapore) (IMMC - Singapore)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Over the March holidays, a group of four Secondary 4 students participated
in the IMMC (Singapore). The IMMC allows students to experience the power
of Mathematics in understanding, analysing and solving real world problems
outside of Mathematics itself. This year, the students worked collaboratively
on developing a model for optimal land use that balances community values
and business profits. They analysed the context provided, hypothesised
and tested several solutions with their teacher advisor before proposing
a working solution to the judging panel. For the past two years, our students
have consistently made us proud by attaining the Certificate of Merit,
a strong testament of their brilliant work. Congratulations to the teams
over the years!</p>

<p><strong><u>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Over the June holidays, a group of Secondary 2 and Secondary 4 students
participated in the SMO, the largest and oldest mathematics competition
in Singapore. The objective of this competition is to test the ingenuity
and mathematical problem-solving ability of the participants and to discover
and encourage mathematical talents in secondary schools, high schools,
and junior colleges in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
