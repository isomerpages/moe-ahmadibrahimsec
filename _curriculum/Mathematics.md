<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<strong>Department Vision</strong><br>

Every AI student, a future-ready and critical thinker with a passion for Mathematics

  

<strong>Department Mission</strong><br>

To nurture students to be confident and inquisitive problem solvers

  

<strong>Department Philosophy</strong><br>

<p>We believe every student can do Mathematics and that a strong foundation in the discipline will benefit them in the future. We strive to develop students’ conceptual understanding, cognitive and metacognitive skills, as well as inspire in our students an appreciation of the beauty and relevance of Mathematics. Through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, we want our students to be curious about the world around them, think creatively and critically in solving real-world problems.</p>

	<p><strong>1. National Digital Literacy Programme</strong></p>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. Teachers are guided by e-Pedagogy to design learning experiences with their personalised learning devices that enable students to acquire and develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions as future-ready learners. In the Mathematics classrooms, technology is leveraged to differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all students, to foster conceptual change as well as support assessment for learning.</p><br>

<p><strong>2. Code for Fun Programme</strong></p>
	<p>Our Secondary 1 students were treated to the ‘Code For Fun’ programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) that exposed them to computational thinking which refers to the ability to use four skills: abstraction, decomposition, generalisation and algorithmic thinking in solving problems.</p><br>

<p>Students first learnt the basics of block-based programming and applied the use of a microcontroller, sensors and coding to facilitate daily activities. As part of the programme, students were engaged in a group task that required them to create simulations to solve real-world problems. For example, one of the teams created a smart fan control system to save energy in the house using the Boson Starter Kit. Through the group task, students acquired and applied concepts of design thinking as well as solved real-world problems with the mathematics and science concepts learnt in the classroom.</p>
