<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>In Science Department, the staff creates a learning environment that focuses on conceptual learning and engages students in meaningful activities that enable them to apply and communicate their knowledge. Technology is used as a tool to help all students actively learn science in an inquiry-based curriculum. The inquiry-based process uses varied instructional strategies and scientific technologies to enable students to develop as self-directed learners.</p>

<div>
<strong>1. Scientific Thinking Programme</strong>
<ul>
<li>Selected 2E students.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Objective: To develop the curiosity of students towards the science of everyday life and the scientific thinking skills required to solve questions of phenomenon happening everyday.</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. Advanced Electives Modules (AEM)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Selected 3E / 4NA</li>
<li>Objective: To provide students with greater exposure to practice-oriented learning approaches and help them discover their strengths and interests.</li>
</ul>
<strong>3. Science Carnival</strong>
<ul>
<li>From building the tallest tower using spaghetti, to finding out how different colours of light can affect photosynthesis, these are some of the activities students can look forward to&nbsp;at the annual Science Carnival. Students get to try out different activities from each science discipline, Physics, Chemistry and Biology, to build up their interest in the learning of Science.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>4. Visit to Science Centre&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objective: It is a systematic way of pursuing a curiosity to its logical end, or, of engaging one&rsquo;s senses (observations) on an intrigue or an enigma and using pre-knowledge, ingenuity and creativity to understand and resolve it &ndash; all in a carefully thought-out, methodical analytical-logical manner.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Scientist for a Day workshop / Sec 1E/1N&nbsp;</li>
</ul><strong>5. Visit to Science Centre (Physics)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Objective: To make students think about friction and how to make structures stable by using diff erent materials. Also, comparison with real-life structures will be highlighted, in particular those able to withstand extreme forces such as earthquakes&nbsp;</li>
<li>Shake Rattle and Roll / Sec 3E/3N&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<strong>6. Visit to Science Centre (Biology)</strong>
<ul>
<li>The objective is to give our students a deeper understanding of life sciences topics and issues, and at the same time stimulate students' interest in taking up careers in the life sciences. This would educate students to be more scientifically literate and later, as adults, they would have more considered views about life sciences issues and concerns.<br />Programmes offered:</li>
<ul>
<li>Finding the Lost Princess - A Forensic Approach</li>
<li>Bacteria Transformation</li>
<li>Genetic Diseases</li>
</ul>
