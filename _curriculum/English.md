<p><strong><u>CAP 2023/2024</u></strong>
<br><strong>2023/2024 CAPpers</strong>
<br>Student-writers in our Creative Writing Programme passionately pursued
their craft, meticulously developing portfolios of original works that
reflect a deep sensitivity to the world around them for the Creative Arts
Programme (CAP). This prestigious programme, jointly organized by the Gifted
Education Branch, MOE, and Yale-NUS College, offers a unique platform for
young and talented writers.
<br>We are proud to announce that in 2023, two of our students, Stella Tong
Chi Ling from 3 Steadfastness and Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence,
were selected to represent AISS at the CAP Seminar, held from 29th May
to 1st June. Continuing this achievement, in 2024, Chang Ling-Chi @ Olivia
Zelda Setiono and Joey Lee Jie Yi, both from 3 Excellence, were also accepted
into CAP, representing AISS at the seminar from 27th to 31st May.</p>
<p>As CAP participants, they engaged in a diverse array of creative writing
workshops, plenary lectures, performance workshops, and enrichment sessions,
all of which pushed their creative boundaries to new heights. We would
like to congratulate them in achieving new and exciting milestones in their
creative writing endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>2023/2024 CAP Mentees</strong>
<br>We are pleased to announce that our 2022 CAPpers, Bellelyn Ong and Klenn
Teo Yuan Jun Kai, successfully submitted their portfolios for the 2023
Mentorship Attachment. As 2023 CAP poetry mentees, they demonstrated a
spirit of excellence, pushing themselves to refine their creative writing
skills under the guidance of a local writer. Their dedication led to the
creation of exceptional poetry pieces, which were selected for publication
in the 2023 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: Making It New.</em>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Bellelyn received special recognition from the CAP Organising
Committee and was invited to recite her published poem, ‘Pulau Ubin &amp;
Painting Lessons (Title of Film) @ National Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP
Seminar Closing Ceremony on 1 June at NAFA. Her performance aimed to inspire
seminar participants from various schools as they embarked on their journeys
as budding writers. Bellelyn was further honored with an invitation to
recite her poem at the 2023 Poetry Festival at NLB on 5th August, where
her work was praised for its craftsmanship and alignment with the festival’s
theme, ‘Sojourners.’ We applaud her outstanding achievements in creative
writing.</p>
<p>Building on this success, Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence was
also successful in his application for the 2024 Mentorship Attachment.
Under the mentorship of a local writer, he crafted remarkable poetry pieces
that were selected for publication in the 2024 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: The Half Familiar.</em> Following
in the footsteps of his seniors, Miguel was chosen to perform a reading
of his poem, ‘Self-portrait of an Art Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP Seminar
2024 Closing Ceremony, carrying forward the legacy of inspiring students
across schools on their creative writing journeys.</p>

<p><strong><u>Creative Writing Workshop 2023</u></strong>
<br>Picture this: The words you have penned on paper dances to the beat of
spoken word poetry, and memorable worlds of wonderful fiction are formed
with little words, quick sentences, and a few characters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what students from our AISS Creative Writing Program experienced
during this year’s Creative Writing Camp, conducted during the last week
of the June’s holidays. Through a series of workshops led by our teachers
as well as established contemporary Singapore writers, Marc Nair and Neil
Humphreys, students gained great insights into the myriad possibilities
of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of the camp, they learnt how to bring their written words to
life as they performed or presented their works in front of an audience.
It was a joy to see them impressing their peers with their brave attempts
at acrostic poetries, visual poetries or prose embellished with detailed
descriptions enhanced by carefully chosen literary devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quickly and adeptly, participants also learnt to create gripping short
fiction–a genre which involves creating impactful narratives composed of
minimal characters governed by one or two central themes and concerns–with
the personalised guidance and feedback from Neil Humphreys, who has published
numerous works.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>After these experiences, these budding writers are encouraged to edit
and improve on their created work, with the guidance and feedback of the
teachers. Their works will subsequently be featured in AISS’s public school
online publication, Contemplations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2023 Creative Writing Workshop</strong>
<br>Writing as a performing art? With singing and serenading to boot?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what students who participated in AISS Creative Writing Workshop
2023 experienced during the first week of the June holidays. They had a
great cathartic release from the online versions conducted over the previous
pandemic years. While acquiring writing strategies over online sessions
was plausible, nothing could beat meeting face-to-face.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two workshops by established contemporary Singapore writers, Marc Nair
and Jennifer Anne Champion, were also conducted, giving participants greater
insights into the myriad possibilities of writing.</p>
<p>Students enjoyed impressing their peers with their brave attempts at acrostic
poems, visual poetries or prose embellished with detailed descriptions
enhanced by carefully chosen literary devices. There was also a sensory
walk to the nearby Sembawang Hot Spring Park to stimulate participants’
imaginations.</p>
<p></p>

<summary><strong>ELL Fest 2023</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The theme for this year's English Language and Literature (ELL) Festival
was ‘Superheroes’, and it's safe to say that our teachers have donned their
capes, forming the formidable ‘Justice Lit’, led by none other than the
illustrious Captain English. Justice Lit is a league of superheroes with
extraordinary literary and linguistic abilities whose mission is to ignite
a spark of excitement in the hearts of our students for English Language
and Literature.</p>
<p>The objectives of the ELL festival were to cultivate a school-wide culture
that nurtures the appreciation of the English Language and Literature while
promoting the sheer joy of learning. And what better way to inspire this
than by organising a series of engaging events, including speech competitions,
spelling bees, and poetry contests, alongside fun and enlightening workshops,
where students and teachers alike can delve into the boundless world of
language and linguistic expressions. A multitude of events have been organised,
each designed to empower our students to harness their inner language superheroes.
Among the highlights are:</p>
<p>1. Spelling Bee (Sec 1s): The Sec 1 students showcased their command over
the English language by competing in a thrilling Spelling Bee. This event
not only tests their linguistic prowess but also fosters healthy competition
and camaraderie. Students were given a treat as they also got to watch
their non-English teachers taking part in the Spelling Bee too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Planned Speech (Sec 2s): The Sec 2 students stepped up to the podium
with well-researched and eloquently delivered speeches. This event not
only honed their public speaking skills but also encouraged critical thinking
and in-depth exploration of literary themes.</p>
<p>3. Impromptu Speech (Sec 3s): The Sec 3 students faced the challenge of
thinking on their feet as they engaged in impromptu speeches. This event
promotes quick thinking, adaptability, and the ability to articulate ideas
effectively, all essential skills for future leaders.</p>
<p>4. Poetry Writing Competition (Whole School): For our passionate literature
enthusiasts, the Poetry Writing Competition provided a platform to unleash
their creativity and express themselves through the art of poetry. It's
an opportunity to dive deep into the world of words and emotions.</p>
<p>But the&nbsp; ELL Festival is not just about competition; it's also about
nurturing talent and fostering a love for the language and its literature.
To that end, the festival includes a series of workshops during the Learning
Fiesta week:</p>
<p>Drama and Poetry Workshops for Sec 1 and 2 Students: These workshops allow
our younger students to explore the world of literature in a dynamic and
interactive way. They get to enact scenes from their favorite plays and
immerse themselves in the beauty of poetic expression.</p>
<p>In the spirit of "Superheroes," Justice Lit members served as guides throughout
the festival, sharing their passion for language and literature with students,
and demonstrating that, indeed, "words are mightier than swords."</p>
<p>The ELL Festival promised to be a spectacular journey, where students
were not only educated but inspired. It is a celebration of language and
literature, a testament to the power of words, and a reminder that each
one of us has the potential to be a superhero in our own literary adventures.</p>
<p>On this extraordinary voyage, let us remember that the true heroes of
the&nbsp; ELL Festival are the students and teachers who came together
to make it a resounding success, forging bonds of learning, creativity,
and camaraderie that will last a lifetime. Here's to a festival filled
with words that leap off the pages and into our hearts, and to superheroes
who inspire us all to explore the limitless horizons of language and literature.</p>
