<p><strong><u>CAP 2023/2024</u></strong>
<br><strong>2023/2024 CAPpers</strong>
<br>Student-writers in our Creative Writing Programme passionately pursued
their craft, meticulously developing portfolios of original works that
reflect a deep sensitivity to the world around them for the Creative Arts
Programme (CAP). This prestigious programme, jointly organized by the Gifted
Education Branch, MOE, and Yale-NUS College, offers a unique platform for
young and talented writers.
<br>We are proud to announce that in 2023, two of our students, Stella Tong
Chi Ling from 3 Steadfastness and Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence,
were selected to represent AISS at the CAP Seminar, held from 29th May
to 1st June. Continuing this achievement, in 2024, Chang Ling-Chi @ Olivia
Zelda Setiono and Joey Lee Jie Yi, both from 3 Excellence, were also accepted
into CAP, representing AISS at the seminar from 27th to 31st May.</p>
<p>As CAP participants, they engaged in a diverse array of creative writing
workshops, plenary lectures, performance workshops, and enrichment sessions,
all of which pushed their creative boundaries to new heights. We would
like to congratulate them in achieving new and exciting milestones in their
creative writing endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>2023/2024 CAP Mentees</strong>
<br>We are pleased to announce that our 2022 CAPpers, Bellelyn Ong and Klenn
Teo Yuan Jun Kai, successfully submitted their portfolios for the 2023
Mentorship Attachment. As 2023 CAP poetry mentees, they demonstrated a
spirit of excellence, pushing themselves to refine their creative writing
skills under the guidance of a local writer. Their dedication led to the
creation of exceptional poetry pieces, which were selected for publication
in the 2023 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: Making It New.</em>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Bellelyn received special recognition from the CAP Organising
Committee and was invited to recite her published poem, ‘Pulau Ubin &amp;
Painting Lessons (Title of Film) @ National Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP
Seminar Closing Ceremony on 1 June at NAFA. Her performance aimed to inspire
seminar participants from various schools as they embarked on their journeys
as budding writers. Bellelyn was further honored with an invitation to
recite her poem at the 2023 Poetry Festival at NLB on 5th August, where
her work was praised for its craftsmanship and alignment with the festival’s
theme, ‘Sojourners.’ We applaud her outstanding achievements in creative
writing.</p>
<p>Building on this success, Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence was
also successful in his application for the 2024 Mentorship Attachment.
Under the mentorship of a local writer, he crafted remarkable poetry pieces
that were selected for publication in the 2024 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: The Half Familiar.</em> Following
in the footsteps of his seniors, Miguel was chosen to perform a reading
of his poem, ‘Self-portrait of an Art Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP Seminar
2024 Closing Ceremony, carrying forward the legacy of inspiring students
across schools on their creative writing journeys.</p>
