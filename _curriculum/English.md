<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>We are delighted to share that our students participated in the 'Tea,
Tiffin, and Poetry' 2024 event at CHIJ St. Nicholas Girls' School. This
event was dedicated to celebrating the art of poetry, offering students
a unique opportunity to engage with local poets and fellow poetry enthusiasts
and embodying our school’s commitment to nurturing the arts and fostering
a love for literature within our community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the event, our students immersed themselves in the rich world of
poetry through reading, writing, and listening to original works. The afternoon
was brimming with creativity and inspiration, enabling students to deepen
their understanding and appreciation of poetic expression. We are proud
of the insights and creative growth our students gained from this memorable
experience.</p>

<p><strong><u>CAP 2023/2024</u></strong>
<br><strong>2023/2024 CAPpers</strong>
<br>Student-writers in our Creative Writing Programme passionately pursued
their craft, meticulously developing portfolios of original works that
reflect a deep sensitivity to the world around them for the Creative Arts
Programme (CAP). This prestigious programme, jointly organized by the Gifted
Education Branch, MOE, and Yale-NUS College, offers a unique platform for
young and talented writers.
<br>We are proud to announce that in 2023, two of our students, Stella Tong
Chi Ling from 3 Steadfastness and Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence,
were selected to represent AISS at the CAP Seminar, held from 29th May
to 1st June. Continuing this achievement, in 2024, Chang Ling-Chi @ Olivia
Zelda Setiono and Joey Lee Jie Yi, both from 3 Excellence, were also accepted
into CAP, representing AISS at the seminar from 27th to 31st May.</p>
<p>As CAP participants, they engaged in a diverse array of creative writing
workshops, plenary lectures, performance workshops, and enrichment sessions,
all of which pushed their creative boundaries to new heights. We would
like to congratulate them in achieving new and exciting milestones in their
creative writing endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>2023/2024 CAP Mentees</strong>
<br>We are pleased to announce that our 2022 CAPpers, Bellelyn Ong and Klenn
Teo Yuan Jun Kai, successfully submitted their portfolios for the 2023
Mentorship Attachment. As 2023 CAP poetry mentees, they demonstrated a
spirit of excellence, pushing themselves to refine their creative writing
skills under the guidance of a local writer. Their dedication led to the
creation of exceptional poetry pieces, which were selected for publication
in the 2023 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: Making It New.</em>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Bellelyn received special recognition from the CAP Organising
Committee and was invited to recite her published poem, ‘Pulau Ubin &amp;
Painting Lessons (Title of Film) @ National Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP
Seminar Closing Ceremony on 1 June at NAFA. Her performance aimed to inspire
seminar participants from various schools as they embarked on their journeys
as budding writers. Bellelyn was further honored with an invitation to
recite her poem at the 2023 Poetry Festival at NLB on 5th August, where
her work was praised for its craftsmanship and alignment with the festival’s
theme, ‘Sojourners.’ We applaud her outstanding achievements in creative
writing.</p>
<p>Building on this success, Rulona Miguel Badilla from 3 Excellence was
also successful in his application for the 2024 Mentorship Attachment.
Under the mentorship of a local writer, he crafted remarkable poetry pieces
that were selected for publication in the 2024 CAP Anthology, <em>Eye on the World: The Half Familiar.</em> Following
in the footsteps of his seniors, Miguel was chosen to perform a reading
of his poem, ‘Self-portrait of an Art Gallery’<em>,</em> at the CAP Seminar
2024 Closing Ceremony, carrying forward the legacy of inspiring students
across schools on their creative writing journeys.</p>

<p><strong><u>Creative Writing Workshop 2023</u></strong>
<br>Picture this: The words you have penned on paper dances to the beat of
spoken word poetry, and memorable worlds of wonderful fiction are formed
with little words, quick sentences, and a few characters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what students from our AISS Creative Writing Program experienced
during this year’s Creative Writing Camp, conducted during the last week
of the June’s holidays. Through a series of workshops led by our teachers
as well as established contemporary Singapore writers, Marc Nair and Neil
Humphreys, students gained great insights into the myriad possibilities
of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of the camp, they learnt how to bring their written words to
life as they performed or presented their works in front of an audience.
It was a joy to see them impressing their peers with their brave attempts
at acrostic poetries, visual poetries or prose embellished with detailed
descriptions enhanced by carefully chosen literary devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quickly and adeptly, participants also learnt to create gripping short
fiction–a genre which involves creating impactful narratives composed of
minimal characters governed by one or two central themes and concerns–with
the personalised guidance and feedback from Neil Humphreys, who has published
numerous works.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>After these experiences, these budding writers are encouraged to edit
and improve on their created work, with the guidance and feedback of the
teachers. Their works will subsequently be featured in AISS’s public school
online publication, Contemplations.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2023 Creative Writing Workshop</strong>
<br>Writing as a performing art? With singing and serenading to boot?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what students who participated in AISS Creative Writing Workshop
2023 experienced during the first week of the June holidays. They had a
great cathartic release from the online versions conducted over the previous
pandemic years. While acquiring writing strategies over online sessions
was plausible, nothing could beat meeting face-to-face.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two workshops by established contemporary Singapore writers, Marc Nair
and Jennifer Anne Champion, were also conducted, giving participants greater
insights into the myriad possibilities of writing.</p>
<p>Students enjoyed impressing their peers with their brave attempts at acrostic
poems, visual poetries or prose embellished with detailed descriptions
enhanced by carefully chosen literary devices. There was also a sensory
walk to the nearby Sembawang Hot Spring Park to stimulate participants’
imaginations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Check out some of these creative works published and featured on <strong><a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/contemplations2022-2023/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Contemplations</a></strong>!</p>

<p>
<br>Only when the instructor, like an accomplished choir master, put participants
through the paces of varying their intonations and conquering tongue twisters,
then some semblance of a public speaking workshop emerges.</p>
<p>
<br>What a fun and engaging workshop which garners high ratings year in and

to provide them with opportunities to put into practice what they have
learnt.</p>

<p>This annual international writing competition provides both budding and
sophisticated writers the much needed opportunities - the former to explore
whether they have what it takes to be a writer and the latter, a means
to pitch their writing skills and creativity against their peers from other
parts of the world. It is no wonder that this competition captures the
imagination of many AI students who participated, enhancing their interest

<p><strong><u>Assembly Programmes</u></strong>
<br>During our weekly assembly, our Reading Ambassadors actively promote our
schools’ reading initiatives, rousing their peers to avidly participate
in reading ventures and borrow books. On 9<sup>th</sup> February 2023, our
Reading Ambassadors, Olivia Zelda Setiano from 2E1 and Javien Quek Wen
Le from 3 Integrity gave a riveting presentation on our library’s thematic
event, ‘Valentine’s Day’, encouraging students to go on blind dates with
books and explore our ‘Busk Me Away Station’ where students can express
their love for creative expression and music through live performances
at the library.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>In another example, during the 30th August Assembly Programme, our Reading
Programme collaborated with the school’s ALP Programme and NLB to address
the contemporary issue of Food Sustainability. Reading Ambassador Fernandez
Ronne Gabrielle Abrenica from 2E3 highlighted recommended reads by NLB,
which were also available on Sora, our school’s digital library. Alongside
the ALP ambassadors, they showcased exemplary vlogs created by students
Fong Siyi, Jolin, and Nadyne Nur Rahilah Binte Hiskandar Numeiry from 4N2.
These vlogs were inspired by The IN Straits Times article, “Going Plastic-Free
For One Day,” from <em>The Environment Issue</em>, underscoring the positive
impact our school’s reading subscription to The IN Straits Times has on
our students.</p>

<p><strong><u>Outreach</u></strong>
<br><strong>AISS Reading Ambassadors Ignite the Joy of Reading in the Community with NLB</strong>
<br>On the 13th of July 2024, our Reading Ambassadors from Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary
School had the incredible opportunity to collaborate with the National
Library Board (NLB) in an outreach event at Yishun Public Library. Titled <em>Tales Come Alive: A Puppetry Reading Adventure</em>,
the event was designed to captivate the imaginations of young readers and
foster a love for storytelling in the community.</p>
<p>Our Reading Ambassadors took center stage, delivering a delightful and
engaging puppetry reading session that brought stories to life. With vibrant
characters, expressive voices, and creative puppetry, they transported
the audience into the magical worlds of their chosen tales. This interactive
and entertaining approach not only captured the attention of the children
but also inspired a renewed interest in reading among the audience members.</p>
<p>The event was a resounding success, with attendees leaving with smiles
on their faces and a spark of curiosity ignited in their hearts. The collaboration
with NLB provided our students with a unique platform to develop their
public speaking and performance skills while contributing meaningfully
to the community.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of our Reading Ambassadors for their dedication,
creativity, and passion for promoting literacy. This outreach event is
a testament to the power of storytelling and the importance of nurturing
a lifelong love for reading.</p>
<p>We look forward to many more opportunities to engage with the community
and spread the joy of reading far and wide!

<p><strong><u>Thematic Events</u></strong>
<br>A new month at our library beckons a new thematic event, calling students
to celebrate significant occasions with the school and their peers as one
AI community. Our students were thrilled to participate in a myriad of
ever-changing activities throughout the year, be it serenading the crowds
at the ‘Busk Me Away’ station for Valentine’s Day or making paper pageant
dolls for International Friendship Day. Not only that, but our library
also collaborated with NPCC to hold an interactive Crime Scene Investigation
where students sleuth and solve a crime mystery and stand a chance at winning
attractive prizes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these activities, students also explore our enticing book displays
such as our mystery reads with alluring teasers tempting them to pick them
up as their next read. With a slew of events, invigorating our library
with a new lease of life each month, we are committed to ignite, in our
students, the passion for reading and exploration!
