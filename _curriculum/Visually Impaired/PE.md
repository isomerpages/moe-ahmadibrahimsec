#### Highlights: 1967 to Present
The record of the highlights and achievements for 1967 to present is a testament to AISS as a model of success for the education of VI students. The VI Support Unit will continue to assist VI students to grow and maximise their potential.

------------------------------------------

In our effort to promote the holistic education of our students, we are constantly working out programmes that will give our VI students the same opportunities for their full development.

The Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) came into partnership with our school to conduct a Physical Education programme for our VI students. The programme commenced on **Wednesday, 11 July 2007**, and was conducted subsequently every Wednesday, during the P.E. periods.

In **2011**, The training was taken over by our own school AED, Mr Casey Lee.

The programme was suspended in **2012** for lack of suitable trained staff but was resumed in **2014**.

In **2012**, to promote appreciation of the Arts, Miss Winnie Lim (the Art teacher) conducted a Tape Sculpture workshop for our VI students and staff. In the same year, we also visited sculptor, Victor Tan’s exhibition, Entitled, INSIGHT.

On the **19th and 20th May, 2015**, a one and a half day Sports Camp was organised in partnership with Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) for our VI students. Seven students participated in the programme which comprised the following activities: goalball game, ballroom dancing and tandem-cycling at East Coast Park.

The trainers enjoyed working with our students as they were responsive and cooperative. They commended our students' cheerfulness and willingness to learn. The teachers observed that the students were very enthusiastic and immensely enjoyed the activities conducted by SDSC officers. We also observed that the students benefited from the programme as reflected in their positive feedback.

AI participated in MOE ExcelFest **2007**, showcasing our Integration Programme for the VI and the various assistive technology devices.

The highlight of **2009** is the Commemoration of the Bicentenary of the birth of Louis Braille, the man who devised the Braille code. 4 VI students presented his life and work at the school weekly assembly. The audience was deeply impressed by the confident and arresting delivery of the 4 students.

To raise public awareness of how man's faithful friend can help the blind, Mr Kua Cheng Hock, from Guide Dogs Association, Singapore, accompanied by his beautiful guide dog, Kendra, gave a talk to the school community on **9th February 2009**.

On **27 May 2009**, together with some students from RGS, we visited an aeroponics farm. The trip was most fascinating as our students were able to feel, smell and taste the vegetables grown on the farm.
 
At the invitation of the NPCC, our VI students ventured to Pulau Ubin, where they walked through the sensory trail and even tried their hands on outdoor cooking! This exhilarating adventure is a rousing round-up to our activities for the year of **2010**.

In **2011**, AI was invited to showcase our devices at YJC Exhibition.

The Sports Carnival is a major annual event of the School. As part of the activities for Sports Carnival **2009**, the Principal, Mr Stephen Chin, and VP, Mdm Rina, together with other staff, volunteers and parents, our VI students trekked through Admiralty Park.

Our VI students continued to participate in the Sports Carnival when the venue was moved to Bedok Reservoir. Since **2014**, Miss Chew Ing Lim, the Principal accompanied us to hike round the reservoir, with the assistance of other staff. Miss Chew’s exemplary participation was a motivating force for the VI students.

Responding to our VI students’ desire for Physical Education, Miss Chew made great effort to provide P.E. for our students. The programme re-commenced in **2014** with the engagement of a fitness instructor. It is ongoing.

We have integrated Soundball to our P.E. programme for the past 3 years and it is still ongoing.
