and expression. It is also a great opportunity for our students to develop
and unleash their creative potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At AISS, we believe that our students are musical, and have the ability
to express themselves musically. Our comprehensive music curriculum aims
to develop musical and extra-musical skills such as listening skills, singing
and playing skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills, and social

Preparatory Course (MPC), which prepares them for the EMP at upper secondary,
culminating in the GCE ‘O’ Level Music examinations.</p>

and collaborations with other institutions, myriad opportunities for exposure
and experiences outside the classroom, and a supportive whole-school musical
culture.</p>

<p><strong><u>Key features of the syllabus</u></strong>
<br>Our comprehensive curriculum caters to various interests and aptitude
levels. Students benefit from the study of Western and Asian music, Jazz
and Pop, music composition, and music theory. Additionally, students in
the EMP will get opportunities to perform as soloists or in ensembles,
benefit from music workshops and masterclasses, and attend learning journeys
and internships with local arts organisations and institutions.</p>
<p>We develop students’ musical knowledge and skills and aim to build up
students’ competence and confidence in music in order for them to study
music at a higher level. The spiral curriculum introduces topics at a foundational
level, and includes foundational music skills such as elements of music,
music theory, music history, aural skills, composition skills, as well
as solo and ensemble performance skills.</p>
<p>Our students also benefit from a comprehensive enrichment programme. Students
experience a wide range of musical activities in and outside of the classroom,
in order to develop skills and competencies for more advanced studies in
music, or to gain awareness of potential careers in Music.</p>
<p><strong><u>Selection Test Information</u></strong>
<br>We conduct auditions and interviews throughout the year as part of our
talent identification process. Suitable candidates in Secondary 1 and 2
can be accepted into the programme.</p>

<p>Music lessons extend to the rest of the AISS student body as well! We
offer a comprehensive yet inclusive music programme that encourages students
to engage actively in music-making, no matter their foundati</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One</strong>
<br>At this level, students will be eased back into music lessons through
a series of thoughtfully curated modules. These modules are designed with
activities to develop students’ confidence and appreciation for music.
Students will be exposed to music from multicultural origins, to harness
stronger awareness for global cultures, as well as Singapore’s own multicultural
society. The following modules aim to support these endeavours:</p>
<p>1. Stories We Sing –
<br>What better way to develop an innate musical sense than to start with
singing? Students will be exposed to foundational singing knowledge and
techniques, and they will proceed to apply them through singing a selection
of contemporary Singapore songs (sung in Chinese, Malay or Tamil languages).</p>
<p>2. Guitar –
<br>Singing can always be spiced up with some instrumental accompaniment.
Students will be introduced to the guitar, and learn of the instrument’s
origins. They will then be equipped with the knowledge and skills of playing
basic chord progressions to accompany singing.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Two</strong>
<br>At this level, students will make music that point more towards the Popular
Music genre. Tapping on their pre-requisite knowledge and skills on singing
and guitar-playing from Secondary One, students will bring them over to
the following modules:</p>
<p>1. Keyboard –
<br>Students will learn about the origins and development of the keyboard.
They will also be able to combine their knowledge of melodies (singing)
and harmonies (guitar chords) and transfer them to keyboard playing. An
updated list of Popular songs will be offered to the students to apply
their singing and instrumental skills, as they present performances to
their schoolmates and teachers</p>
<p>2. Battle of the Bands –
<br>To sum up the students’ lower secondary music programme, we combine singing,
guitar- and keyboard-playing, getting students to form a Pop band. Each
band will arrange and perform a song cover from the song list provided
in the Keyboard Module, preparing for their final showcase to their schoolmates
and teachers.</p>

<summary><strong>WHY STUDY MUSIC?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Music opens up multiple career pathways for students, not just in performing.
They can choose to step into audio production and sound designing, songwriting
and composing, live sound, film music composition, conducting, music therapy
and many others in future! Music also develops many transferable skills
such as teamwork, perseverance, creativity, and discipline. Whatever your
future aspirations, the study of music will help you get there!</p>
