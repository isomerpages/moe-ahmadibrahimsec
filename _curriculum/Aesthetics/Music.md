<p>We are a group of passionate Music educators who love our subject and
love teaching it even more! We believe that Music is an avenue for catharsis
and expression. It is also a great opportunity for our students to develop
and unleash their creative potential.</p>
<p>At AISS, we believe that our students are musical, and have the ability
to express themselves musically. Our comprehensive music curriculum aims
to develop musical and extra-musical skills such as listening skills, singing
and playing skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills, and social
skills.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Enhanced Music Programme (EMP) is a two-year upper secondary programme
that allows students with musical potential, aptitude and passion to pursue
a deeper study of music. AISS is one of only four schools in Singapore
to offer the EMP and serves as an O-Level/G3 Music Centre for students
from other schools across Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lower secondary students may enroll in our Music Preparatory Course (MPC),
which prepares them for the EMP at upper secondary, culminating in the
GCE ‘O’ Level/SEC G3 Music or Higher Music examinations.</p>

<p>Music lessons extend to the rest of the AISS student body as well! We
offer a comprehensive yet inclusive music programme that encourages students
to engage actively in music-making, no matter their foundation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our lower secondary music curriculum exposes students to music from various
traditions and genres, from local and Southeast Asian music to jazz and
contemporary popular styles. The curriculum is structured around four key
modules designed to build core musical skills while fostering creativity,
collaboration, and appreciation for different musical cultures.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Stories We Sing –</strong>
</p>
<p>This module introduces students to the joy of music through singing. They
will develop foundational vocal techniques and aural awareness, while also
honing their rhythmic sense through body percussion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2. Guitar –</strong>
</p>
<p>To complement their vocal learning, students will explore playing on the
guitar. This module equips them with basic chord progressions and strumming
patterns, enabling them to accompany songs with an instrument.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>3. Keyboard –</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will explore basic keyboard techniques, learning to play both
melodies and chords. This module helps deepen their understanding of harmony
and melody, expanding their versatility as young musicians.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>4. Battle of the Bands –</strong>
</p>
<p>The curriculum culminates in a collaborative project, where students form
pop bands, bringing together skills from previous modules – singing, guitar,
and keyboard – to arrange and perform a cover of a song. Their final performance
is showcased to peers and teachers, celebrating their musical journey and
teamwork.</p>
