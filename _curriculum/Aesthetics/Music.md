### About Us
<img src="/images/MusicCoverImageReplacement.jpg" style="width: 75%;">
<p>We are a group of passionate Music educators who love our subject and love teaching it even more! We believe that Music is an avenue for catharsis and expression. It is also a great opportunity for our students to develop and unleash their creative potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At AISS, we believe that our students are musical, and have the ability to express themselves musically. Our comprehensive music curriculum aims to develop musical and extra-musical skills such as listening skills, singing and playing skills, fine motor skills, creative thinking skills, and social skills.</p>

<p>AISS is one of only four EMP (Enhanced Music Programme) schools in Singapore. We are also an O-Level Music Centre for students across Singapore who want to offer O-Level Music. As one of our school’s signature programmes, the AISS EMP is a four-year programme for Secondary One to Four students, culminating in the GCE ‘O’ Level Music examinations.</p>
<p>Our unique programme includes talent identification and development, mentorships and collaborations with other institutions, myriad opportunities for exposure and experiences outside the classroom, and a supportive whole-school musical culture. Our cutting-edge music technology-based curriculum encourages experimentation and expression, and many opportunities to perform and compose music using music technology.</p>
<p>Join us to experience a unique musical journey!</p>

Additionally, students in the EMP will get opportunities to perform as soloists or in ensembles, benefit from music workshops and masterclasses, and attend learning journeys and internships with local arts organisations and institutions.</p>
<p>We develop students’ musical knowledge and skills and aim to build up students’ competence and confidence in music in order for them to study music at a higher level. The spiral curriculum introduces topics at a foundational level, and includes foundational music skills such as elements of music, music theory, music history, aural skills, composition skills, as well as solo and ensemble performance skills.</p>
<p>Our students also benefit from a comprehensive enrichment programme. Students experience a wide range of musical activities in and outside of the classroom, in order to develop skills and competencies for more advanced studies in music, or to gain awareness of potential careers in Music.</p>

<div>
<img src="/images/lowersecphoto.jpg" style="width: 55%;">
<p>Music lessons extend to the rest of the AISS student body as well! We offer a comprehensive yet inclusive music programme that encourages students to engage actively in music-making, no matter their foundati</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One</strong></p>
<p>At this level, students will be eased back into music lessons through a series of thoughtfully curated modules. These modules are designed with activities to develop students’ confidence and appreciation for music. Students will be exposed to music from multicultural origins, to harness stronger awareness for global cultures, as well as Singapore’s own multicultural society. The following modules aim to support these endeavours:</p>
<p>1.  Stories We Sing – <br>What better way to develop an innate musical sense than to start with singing? Students will be exposed to foundational singing knowledge and techniques, and they will proceed to apply them through singing a selection of contemporary Singapore songs (sung in Chinese, Malay or Tamil languages).</p>
<p>2.  Guitar – <br>Singing can always be spiced up with some instrumental accompaniment. Students will be introduced to the guitar, and learn of the instrument’s origins. They will then be equipped with the knowledge and skills of playing basic chord progressions to accompany singing.</p>
<p><strong>Secondary Two</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>At this level, students will make music that point more towards the Popular Music genre. Tapping on their pre-requisite knowledge and skills on singing and guitar-playing from Secondary One, students will bring them over to the following modules:</p>
<p>1.  Keyboard –  <br>Students will learn about the origins and development of the keyboard. They will also be able to combine their knowledge of melodies (singing) and harmonies (guitar chords) and transfer them to keyboard playing. An updated list of Popular songs will be offered to the students to apply their singing and instrumental skills, as they present performances to their schoolmates and teachers</p>
<p>2.  Battle of the Bands – <br>To sum up the students’ lower secondary music programme, we combine singing, guitar- and keyboard-playing, getting students to form a Pop band. Each band will arrange and perform a song cover from the song list provided in the Keyboard Module, preparing for their final showcase to their schoolmates and teachers.</p>

</li><li><input type="checkbox" id="accordion3"> <label for="accordion3">WHY STUDY MUSIC?</label>
<div>
<p>Music opens up multiple career pathways for students, not just in performing. They can choose to step into audio production and sound designing, songwriting and composing, live sound, film music composition, conducting, music therapy and many others in future! Music also develops many transferable skills such as teamwork, perseverance, creativity, and discipline. Whatever your future aspirations, the study of music will help you get there!</p>
