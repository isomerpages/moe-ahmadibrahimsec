<p><strong>Sec 4 Level</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are sitting for this year’s GCE Art Syllabus T (6128) and in
this final lap, they concentrate on preparing for their portfolio and working
towards perfecting their research, drawings, and creativity skills. At
the end of this year, students will get to be in touch with the various
forms of art such as acrylic painting, charcoal drawing, papercut and assemblage
art.</p>
<p><strong>Art Enrichment:</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe the classroom is not the only way to understand and learn about
art. Hence, the Art Unit has incorporated artist workshops (like the images
of the ceramic workshop below) and visits to the Esplanade to enhance students'
knowledge of the Arts in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong><u>Ideas for Design @Temasek Polytechnic</u></strong>
<br>Our students visited Temasek Polytechnic for the Ideas for Design AEM
in 2022. This group was a mix of Art students and other students who were
just interested in the AEM. These students refreshed their learning in
the basics of Art before up-cycling a found object into an artwork. Our
students also went on a tour of the Design School in Temasek Polytechnic
and learned about the courses available. Our students were very impressed
with the projects that Temasek Polytechnic students had participated in.
All in all, our students found this AEM valuable because it gave them the
time to conceptualise their own unique approach to creating artwork in
a leisurely way and also think about what they wanted to do to further
their education.</p>
<p><strong><u>The ABCs of Making Games - Logic, Art &amp; User Experience</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Working from concept to prototype for a playable 2D game, 19 Secondary
Three art students spent four days of their March school holidays designing
an interactive game at Nanyang Polytechnic.</p>
<p>From understanding user experience, interactive design to crafting a good
gaming experience, the students had fun learning these valuable new skills
and applying the knowledge gained from the lecturers. The workshop, which
was specially designed to engage and inspire secondary school students,
helped the students discover new strengths and interest. It also provided
an authentic learning experience that would help them make a more well-informed
decision on their post-secondary options.</p>
