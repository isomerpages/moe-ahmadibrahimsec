</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In line with our department’s mission to develop students’ interest in
participating in physical activities and practicing a healthy lifestyle,
the PE department has been organizing OLE programmes for the Secondary
1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>OLE</strong> in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS) is an integral
part of the school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), designed to provide
students with a diverse range of experiences aimed at developing their
social-emotional competencies and fostering strong values.</p>
<p><strong>OLE&nbsp;</strong>is about learning through direct experience
in the outdoor environment or in nature. The activities are inherently
students centered and hands on, conducted outside the traditional confine
of the classrooms, as such students tend to be excited and enthusiastic
participants.</p>
<p>Currently, the OLE programmes for the Secondary 1 students is a 4 days
residential camp, Secondary 2 students is a 2 days non-residential camp,
Secondary 3 students is a 4 days residential camp. The OLE activities include
camping, trekking, challenge rope course and team building activities.</p>
<p><strong>Through these outdoor experiences, we wish to:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>OLE 1</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Build Resilience,
teamwork and develop a sense of Awareness to Oneself, Others and pride
to local outdoor Environment&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OLE 2</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Provide opportunities
to build self-confidence, develop an Adventurous spirit and enhancing Sense
of Belonging through shared common experience</p>
<p><strong>OLE 3&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Application of Outdoor skills in nature,
developing Character and enhancing environmental/cultural awareness.</p>
