<p>OLE (Outdoor Learning Experience) 1,2,3<br />In line with our department&rsquo;s mission to develop students&rsquo; interest in participating in physical activities and practicing a healthy lifestyle, the PE department has been organizing OLE (Outdoor Learning Experience) programmes for the Secondary 1,2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>OLE&nbsp;</strong>is about learning through direct experience in the outdoor environment or in nature. The activities are inherently students centered and hands on, conducted outside the traditional confine of the classrooms, as such students tend to be excited and enthusiastic participants.</p>
<p>Currently, the OLE programmes for the<br />Secondary 1 students is a 4 days non-residential camp,<br />Secondary 2 students is a 4 days residential camp in Singapore,<br />Secondary 3 students is a 4 days overseas expedition.<br />The OLE activities include camping, rock-climbing, trekking, kayaking, challenge rope course and group initiative games.</p>
<p><strong>Through these outdoor experiences, we wish to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>OLE 1</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Build Resilience, teamwork and develop a sense of Awareness to Oneself, Others and pride to local outdoor Environment&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OLE 2</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Provide opportunities to build self-confidence, develop an Adventurous spirit and enhancing Sense of Belonging through shared common experience</p>
<p><strong>OLE 3&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Application of Outdoor skills in nature, developing Character and enhancing environmental/cultural awareness.</p>

<p>The focus of the Sports Carnival is mass participation. It consists both land and Water activities. In Water activities, there are Dragon Boat Races for the top 8 Classes of each level on the actual day. Qualifying races were conducted days. There are also inter-class Kayaking races for all the levels. It consists of 3 categories; Boys Doubles, Girls Doubles and Mixed Doubles.</p>
