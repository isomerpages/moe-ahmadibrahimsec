<p>OLE (Outdoor Learning Experience) 1,2,3
<br>In line with our department’s mission to develop students’ interest in
participating in physical activities and practicing a healthy lifestyle,
the PE department has been organizing OLE (Outdoor Learning Experience)
programmes for the Secondary 1,2 and 3.</p>
<p><strong>OLE&nbsp;</strong>is about learning through direct experience
in the outdoor environment or in nature. The activities are inherently
students centered and hands on, conducted outside the traditional confine
of the classrooms, as such students tend to be excited and enthusiastic
participants.</p>
<p>Currently, the OLE programmes for the Secondary 1 students is a 4 days
residential camp, Secondary 2 students is a 2 days non-residential camp,
Secondary 3 students is a 4 days residential camp. The OLE activities include
camping, trekking, kayaking, challenge rope course and group initiative
games.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Through these outdoor experiences, we wish to:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>OLE 1</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Build Resilience,
teamwork and develop a sense of Awareness to Oneself, Others and pride
to local outdoor Environment&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OLE 2</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;Provide opportunities
to build self-confidence, develop an Adventurous spirit and enhancing Sense
of Belonging through shared common experience</p>
<p><strong>OLE 3&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Application of Outdoor skills in nature,
developing Character and enhancing environmental/cultural awareness.</p>

<p>Sports Carnival</p>
<p>Our Annual Sport Carnival plays an important role in promoting physical
activities and healthy lifestyle. It also provides opportunities for building
class spirit and teacher-student bonding.</p>
<p>The focus of the Sports Carnival is mass participation. It consists both
land and Water activities. In Water activities, there are Dragon Boat Races
for the top 8 Classes of each level on the actual day. Qualifying races
were conducted days. There are also inter-class Kayaking races for all
the levels. It consists of 3 categories; Boys Doubles, Girls Doubles and
Mixed Doubles.</p>
<p>The Land activities consist of inter-class Cross-Country races for the
different levels. The pupils are required to do a 3.8km run around the
Bedok Reservoir Park. A series of Team Games were also introduced in 2012
as part of the Land activities to cater to students are less athletically
inclined and to promote class spirit.</p>
