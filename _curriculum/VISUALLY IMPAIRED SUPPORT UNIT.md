<p>We believe that visual impairment is not a hindrance but a challenge. With training, support and guidance, visually impaired (VI) students can achieve academic success and develop strength of character to meet life&rsquo;s challenges.</p>
<p>The Integration Programme for the Visually impaired (IPVI) is a measure to provide secondary education for VI students in a mainstream school. Implemented in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary school (AISS) in 1967, the school continues to be committed to the education of VI students today.</p>
<p>AISS adopts a fully concerted approach to provide the opportunities, facilities and support to ensure VI students receive a holistic education that enables them to achieve academic success and develop strength of character.</p>
