<p><strong>Highlights: 1967 to Present</strong></p>
<p>The record of the highlights and achievements for 1967 to present is a testament to AISS as a model of success for the education of VI students. The VI Support Unit will continue to assist VI students to grow and maximise their potential.</p>
<hr />
<p>AISS has been noted for its commitment to education for the visually impaired (VI). It is through the support of MOE and the cooperation and commitment of Principals, staff and students of AISS that the IPVI is successfully integrated VI students into the school and preparing them for the future.</p>
<p>The school has been a model of success in education for the VI since the inception of the IPVI in 1967.</p>
<p>In <strong>1981</strong>, a professor from Germany, who promoted Integration Education for the Disabled, visited the school and shared ideas with the Resource teachers, who also attended a lecture given by him at the Goethe Institute.</p>
<p>In <strong>1983</strong>, two officers from the Brunei Department of Education, on a study tour on Special Education, studied our programme with the intention of implementing a similar programme in Brunei.</p>
<p>In <strong>1987</strong>, AISS received the Guinness Stout Award for its contribution to the education of the VI. Guinness Stout Company presents an annual award to individuals or institutions which make significant contribution to society or the nation. The school was presented with our first talking computer, Cubic99, a copy of the Guinness Book of Records and a plaque of recognition.</p>
<p>In <strong>May 1997</strong>, the principal and 3 teachers from the Beijing School for the VI visited AISS and shared ideas with Mr Ng Chew Kee Senior HOD), Mr Liow (HOD-Mother Tongue) and Miss Deborah Ng. Four VI students from Singapore, two of whom were Khoo Teck Chuan and Penny Chong (former students of AISS) spent two months in&nbsp;<strong>1997</strong> in Beijing studying the Chinese Braille code.</p>
<p>Ms Deborah Ng and Mdm Betty Frois attended a conference organised by Teach Me Services on &ldquo;Integration as a Lifestyle for the Disabled&rdquo; on <strong>23 June 2001</strong> at Grand Hyatt Hotel.</p>
<p>In <strong>February 2003</strong>, Mr David Spyby (Head of Mathematics department of Royal National Institute for the Blind New College at Worcester, England) who is engaged by GCE N/O Level examination authorities to modify the Mathematics examination papers for VI students from Singapore and other parts of the world, together with Dr Wong Meng Ee (a VI Singaporean who studied in Worcester College and a graduate of a University in Scotland) visited the school to observe our teaching programme for the VI and shared knowledge and experiences, in particular, in relation to examination requirements.</p>
<p>The World Blind Union Regional Conference (Pacific &amp; Asia) cum Seminar on Barrier-Free Accessibility for the Visually Impaired was held in Singapore, <strong>15-20 November 2003</strong>. Resource teachers, Betty Frois and Deborah Ng, sponsored by the school Staff Development Fund, attended the above conference cum seminar held at Swisshotel Merchant Court. Delegates from Japan, Australia and New Zealand delivered papers on Barrier-free Accessibility to information and the environment. Topics covered various information systems and library resources and the use of tactile and sound/speech signals and guide dogs. There was also an exhibition of various assistive devices, such as Braille embossers, text-scanning/reading machines, Braille and graphics displays, speech software, an accessory to the Braille Note which can be used as a navigation device via GPS, and another device that enables a VI person to access the Internet via a mobile phone. The Resource teachers gained valuable knowledge from the conference cum seminar.</p>
<p>AI received a distinguished guest from The Netherlands (Dr. Suzan IjZer, ophthalmologist working on a project called REACH) on <strong>23 Jan 2007.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Highlights: 1967 to Present</strong></p>
<p>The record of the highlights and achievements for 1967 to present is a testament to AISS as a model of success for the education of VI students. The VI Support Unit will continue to assist VI students to grow and maximise their potential.</p>
<p>During the June vacation in&nbsp;<strong>1983</strong>, five students, accompanied by Ms Betty Frois, Miss Deborah Ng and two sighted volunteers, went on a study tour to Penang. They stayed three days at the St. Nicholas School for the Blind and visited other sites in Penang.</p>
<p>Ms Deborah Ng accompanied Sec 2T2 student, Mohd Iskandar, to attend Sports camp organised by SSCD on&nbsp;<strong>28-29 May 2001</strong>&nbsp;at Temasik Polytechnic.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>February 2003</strong>,the Sec 1 and 2 students were brought to the school gym to try out various equipment. Subsequently, 2 Sec 1 students attended 6 sessions at the gym, supervised by the school Leo Club members.</p>
<p>During the SARS crisis in <strong>2003</strong>, when all students were provided with ODTs to measure their body temperature, attempts were made to source for talking oral digital thermometers; only 2 were available and these were purchased by the school and issued to the two totally blind students (Lee Mei Ting of Sec 4N1 and Seet Yong Chye of Sec 1N1).</p>
<p>On <strong>25 May 2003</strong>, the Independent Society of the Blind donated 12 units of the talking oral digital Thermometer and 1 unit of the talking infra-red ear thermometer to our school. All VI staff and students received a unit each.</p>
<p>When our school came under MOE's Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing schools (PRIME), plans were laid for the building of a special room, fitted, equipped and furnished with facilities customised for our VI students.</p>
<p>The new Resource Room was completed in <strong>June 2004</strong> and the IPVI moved into the new location in July. The new room is large and spacious which provides a conducive learning environment for our students.</p>
<p>Under PRIME, the school also made a great effort to build in features, which would be user-friendly to the VI. The features include - textured-tile trails leading from the school's front porch to the Admin office, the canteen, the toilets and the Resource Room;<br />- texture floor tiles for locating staircases;<br />- Braille signages for strategic locations;<br />- covered drains; and<br />- strong colour contrasts for the low vision students.</p>
<p>The Daily Living Skills (DLS) training module was conceived and implemented in AISS in <strong>September 2004</strong> as an enrichment programme to equip our VI students with essential life skills. The ultimate goal is personal preparation for self-reliance.<br />To service this training programme, the new purpose-built room was fitted with washing and cooking facilities (sink, counter, cabinets, cooking appliances and utensils).</p>
<p>With the unreserved support of Mr Tan Keng Joo (the Principal) and encouragement from Mrs Lim Yap Cheng (HOD &ndash; Pastoral Care and Career Guidance), the DLS training module was planned and develop. The training process will prepare VI students to perform daily living activities safely and independently in a familiar environment. Skills taught included meal preparation, household chores and the use of kitchen appliances. The DLS training module is ongoing.</p>
<p>On <strong>23rd March 2006</strong>, members of our school&rsquo;s Leo Club, together with a team of 7 under-graduates from SMU, co-organised an excursion for the VI students of our school to Mount Faber, where there is a wall relief, consisting of 16 panels of tactile murals, depicting the history of Singapore from being a fishing village to an independent nation. The VI students learnt about the past by feeling the tactile pictures, portraying significant moments of our history and features of the different cultures.</p>
<p>The excursion also provided an opportunity outside of school for VI and sighted students to interact and build friendships. Both VI students and their sighted peers thoroughly enjoyed the event. It was a learning experience for all involved.</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, we sent our VI students for the Work Experience Programme (WEP). Shermaine Chiam and Rendi Toh (3T1) wentto Dialogue in the Dark for their WEP over 8 weeks. This programmehopes to encourage greater self-confidence and a hands-on opportunityfor the students to experience a working life.</p>
<p>In <strong>2018</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Lawrence Gabriel</strong>&nbsp;(1E2) is a flutist in the AI Concert Band. In&nbsp;<strong>August</strong>, he performed in the Aespire Concert, together with his section&nbsp;leader. He is also in the Music Preparatory Class, riding on the&nbsp;initiative taken by AI to support VI students sitting for O-Level&nbsp;Music. On&nbsp;<strong>1 July</strong>, he took part in the Purple Symphony at the&nbsp;University Cultural Centre.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<strong>18 April 2018</strong>, we hosted a group of Vietnamese delegate from Nguyen Dinh Chiu School for the Blind, Ho Chih Minh City during their studytrip to Singapore. We shared our VI programme and showcased our assistive devices used in the teaching and learning.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<strong>30 October 2018</strong>, VI students and staff were invited to attend the soft&nbsp;launch of the Touch Collection in the Singapore Art Museum (SAM). SAM&nbsp;has specially produced replicas of selected national art pieces for VI&nbsp;people to feel during their visits to SAM. Audio descriptions are also&nbsp;available during their exploration of the artworks. This will&nbsp;certainly promote a deeper understanding and hence greater&nbsp;appreciation towards art among the VI students.</p>
<p>Our students went on several learning journeys which enhanced their learning.</p>
<p><strong>2006:</strong>&nbsp;Mount Faber Excursion<br /><strong>2007:</strong>&nbsp;Dragon boat<br /><strong>2008:</strong>&nbsp;Labrador Excursion<br /><strong>2009:</strong>&nbsp;Aerogreen Farm Visit<br /><strong>2012:</strong>&nbsp;Activity at Planet Bowl at Civil Service Club, Tessensohn Road</p>

<p><strong>Highlights: 1967 to Present</strong></p>
<p>The record of the highlights and achievements for 1967 to present is a testament to AISS as a model of success for the education of VI students. The VI Support Unit will continue to assist VI students to grow and maximise their potential.</p>
<p>In our effort to promote the holistic education of our students, we are constantly working out programmes that will give our VI students the same opportunities for their full development.</p>
<p>The Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) came into partnership with our school to conduct a Physical Education programme for our VI students. The programme commenced on <strong>Wednesday, 11 July 2007</strong>, and was conducted subsequently every Wednesday, during the P.E. periods.</p>
<p>In <strong>2011</strong>, The training was taken over by our own school AED, Mr Casey Lee.<br />The programme was suspended in&nbsp;<strong>2012</strong> for lack of suitable trained staff but was resumed in <strong>2014</strong>.</p>
<p>In <strong>2012</strong>, to promote appreciation of the Arts, Miss Winnie Lim (the Art teacher) conducted a Tape Sculpture workshop for our VI students and staff. In the same year, we also visited sculptor, Victor Tan&rsquo;s exhibition, Entitled, INSIGHT.</p>
<p>On the&nbsp;<strong>19th and 20th May, 2015</strong>, a one and a half day Sports Camp was organised in partnership with Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) for our VI students. Seven students participated in the programme which comprised the following activities: goalball game, ballroom dancing and tandem-cycling at East Coast Park.</p>
<p>The trainers enjoyed working with our students as they were responsive and cooperative. They commended our students' cheerfulness and willingness to learn. The teachers observed that the students were very enthusiastic and immensely enjoyed the activities conducted by SDSC officers. We also observed that the students benefited from the programme as reflected in their positive feedback.</p>
<p>AI participated in MOE ExcelFest&nbsp;<strong>2007</strong>, showcasing our Integration Programme for the VI and the various assistive technology devices.</p>
<p>The highlight of&nbsp;<strong>2009</strong>&nbsp;is the Commemoration of the Bicentenary of the birth of Louis Braille, the man who devised the Braille code.&nbsp;4 VI students presented his life and work at the school weekly assembly. The audience was deeply impressed by the confident and arresting delivery of the 4 students.</p>
<p>To raise public awareness of how man's faithful friend can help the blind, Mr Kua Cheng Hock, from Guide Dogs Association, Singapore, accompanied by his beautiful guide dog, Kendra, gave a talk to the school community on&nbsp;<strong>9th February 2009</strong>.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;<strong>27 May 2009</strong>, together with some students from RGS, we visited an aeroponics farm. The trip was most fascinating as our students were able to feel, smell and taste the vegetables grown on the farm.</p>
<p>At the invitation of the NPCC, our VI students ventured to Pulau Ubin, where they walked through the sensory trail and even tried their hands on outdoor cooking! This exhilarating adventure is a rousing round-up to our activities for the year of&nbsp;<strong>2010</strong>.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<strong>2011</strong>, AI was invited to showcase our devices at YJC Exhibition.</p>
<p>The Sports Carnival is a major annual event of the School. As part of the activities for Sports Carnival&nbsp;<strong>2009</strong>, the Principal, Mr Stephen Chin, and VP, Mdm Rina, together with other staff, volunteers and parents, our VI students trekked through Admiralty Park.</p>
<p>Our VI students continued to participate in the Sports Carnival when the venue was moved to Bedok Reservoir. Since&nbsp;<strong>2014</strong>, Miss Chew Ing Lim, the Principal accompanied us to hike round the reservoir, with the assistance of other staff. Miss Chew&rsquo;s exemplary participation was a motivating force for the VI students.</p>
<p>Responding to our VI students&rsquo; desire for Physical Education, Miss Chew made great effort to provide P.E. for our students. The programme re-commenced in&nbsp;<strong>2014</strong> with the engagement of a fitness instructor. It is ongoing.</p>
<p>We have integrated Soundball to our P.E. programme for the past 3 years and it is still ongoing.</p>
