<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>The AI Humanities Department aims to inspire learners with strong critical thinking skills, a global outlook, and the confidence to engage others responsibly in a globalised world.</p><br>


<p>The Department’s mission is two-fold: First, to strengthen students’ ability to draw connections between their understanding of the past and the current changing environments to help them better navigate the complex, uncertain future. In doing so, the department focuses on developing 21st Century and self-directed learning competencies in our students while keeping them rooted in strong values.</p><br>

<p>Second, to empower teachers in harnessing the affordances of Blended Learning and technology in delivering a learner-focused curriculum that is both engaging and rigorous, so as to inspire a passion and love for the Humanities among our students.</p>

<p><strong>Blended Learning & e-Pedagogy</strong></p>
<p>With the use of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students are able to access a wealth of information online to support their learning in the classroom. In Geography classrooms, for example, students analyse digital maps that reveal multiple layers of information such as temperature, rainfall and air pressure.</p><br>

<p>In Social Studies classrooms, students collaborate on online platforms such as Padlet to collaborate with one another. Through the use of PLDs, teachers are able to give immediate real-time feedback on students’ online work which helps them close learning gaps quickly. The PLDs also enable students to engage in peer-feedback, as they apply their understanding of a skill to assess their peers’ work, offering suggestions on how peers’ answers can be improved. To consolidate their learning, students reflect on their own learning gaps and prior misconceptions. Teachers often guide students in also reflecting on the challenges they faced and how they overcame these challenges during the lesson, through applying our school values such as resilience and a mindset of excellence.</p><br>
