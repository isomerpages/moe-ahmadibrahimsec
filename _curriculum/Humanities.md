<h2>Humanities</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The AI Humanities Department aims to inspire learners with strong critical
thinking skills, a global outlook, and the confidence to engage others
responsibly in a globalised world.</p>
<p>The Department’s mission is two-fold:</p>
<p>First, we aim to enhance students' ability to connect their understanding
of the past with current changing environments, preparing them to navigate
a complex, uncertain future. This involves developing 21st-century competencies
and self-directed learning skills while grounding them in strong values.</p>
<p>Second, we aim to empower and enable each other to effectively use Blended
Learning and technology in delivering an engaging and rigorous learner-focused
curriculum. This approach seeks to inspire a passion and love for the Humanities
among students.
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Programmes</p>
<p><strong>Blended Learning &amp; e-Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p>With the use of Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students are able to
access a wealth of information online to support their learning in the
classroom. In Geography classrooms, for example, students analyse digital
maps that reveal multiple layers of information such as temperature, rainfall
and air pressure.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>In Social Studies classrooms, students collaborate on online platforms
such as Padlet to collaborate with one another. Through the use of PLDs,
teachers are able to give immediate real-time feedback on students’ online
work which helps them close learning gaps quickly. The PLDs also enable
students to engage in peer-feedback, as they apply their understanding
of a skill to assess their peers’ work, offering suggestions on how peers’
answers can be improved. To consolidate their learning, students reflect
on their own learning gaps and prior misconceptions. Teachers often guide
students in also reflecting on the challenges they faced and how they overcame
these challenges during the lesson, through applying our school values
such as resilience and a mindset of excellence.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Spatial Thinkers using Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>The COVID-19 situation has posed limitations to group-based Geographical
Fieldwork. However, this did not stop our students from engaging in meaningful
activities that helped them visualize space. With the aid of technology
and Geographical Information Systems (GIS), we brought the world into Geography
classrooms. Equipped with iPads and interactive maps, students navigated
different layers of information to learn about topics such as global water
storages and the location of tropical rainforests around the world. Using
Google Maps, students were also able to embark on virtual fieldtrips around
the world.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>As part of their Geographical Investigation, Secondary 2 students also
utilized GIS and digital maps to investigate what makes Chong Pang City
special to its residents. Digital maps allowed students to learn about
the age of HDB flats surrounding Chong Pang, and the range of facilities
and amenities in Chong Pang City. Through student reflections and mental
maps, students gained an enriched understanding of what makes Chong Pang
City special to its residents.</p>

<h5>Adopting an Inquiry Approach to Develop Critical Thinkers &amp; Self-Directed Learners</h5>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 65%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Picture6.jpg">
</div>
<p>With Singapore facing the challenges of an ageing population, our Secondary
2 students investigated if Yishun is an inclusive place for the elderly.
With the ease in Covid-19 measurements, the students could finally embark
on a learning journey! Students conducted independent field investigations
on the inclusivity of facilities and walking paths in Chong Pang. At the
end of the investigation, our Secondary 2 Geographers put on their thinking
caps and came up with proposals to improve the facilities and walking paths
of Chong Pang City, such as an increased number of benches as resting points
for the elderly. Overall, the GI not only offered them an opportunity to
hone their critical thinking skills but to also make a difference in the
lives of others.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, the Secondary 2 students partook in an Historical Investigation
activity where they explored the inquiry question: How did healthcare in
Singapore change after 1965 to the late 1980s?.</p>
<p>Through the investigation, students were better able to understand the
healthcare policies, infrastructure, and services introduced by the Singapore
government since independence. Students were also excited to learn more
about Encik Ahmad Ibrahim, whom our school is named after. Encik Ahmad
Ibrahim had served as the Minister of Health from 1959-1961 and played
a significant role in tackling healthcare issues from the spread of infectious
diseases to improving the quality of healthcare services in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Social Studies Investigation</strong>
</p>
<p>Through a digital virtual learning journey organised by Migrant X Me,
our students (virtually) traversed the streets of Little India, Jalan Besar,
and neighborhood. Our students took a tiny glimpse into the lives of migrant
workers. Our students heard their struggles, their stories and the stigma
migrant workers faced in Singapore. Drawing on the anecdotal evidence,
diverse perspectives, and intensive research, our students unpacked the
multifaceted issue. By undertaking Issues Investigation, our students scrutinized
stereotypes, questioned their prejudices, and uncovered the complexities
that shaped the issue. The students formed their conclusions and presented
their findings in an infographic.</p>

<p><strong>Humuanites Trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia 2019</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>slideshow to be uploaded on google slides</p>
<p>During the June holiday break, the Humanities department conducted a 6-Day,
5 Night Learning Journey and cultural exchange programme to Yogyakarta,
Indonesia for the Secondary Three Humanities students. The objective of
the trip was to help students develop a greater appreciation towards Indonesian
history and geography.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The students visited cultural landmarks in Yogyakarta such as Borobudur
Temple and Ratu Boko temple, which are classified as UNSECO heritage sites
around the world. These locations filled the students with wonder as they
were better able to appreciate the deep religious ties that the people
had within their culture. In addition, visits to the Old Benteng Vredeburg
Fortress museum also served to provide students with greater insight into
the Colonial history of Indonesia for the students. Apart from historical
insights, the trip also served to provide students with an experiential
learning opportunity to discover the beauty and ferocity of mother nature
as well. Through the use of jeeps, the students explored the various segments
of Mount Merapi to learn more about the impact of volcanic activities upon
the livelihood of people. Afterwhich, by taking a leap of faith, the students
absailied into Jomblang cave and were amazed by the process of cave formations.
Lastly, the students also immersed themselves into the cultural practices
of the people by participating in rice planting activities and Batik making
sessions.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The students had great fun learning and exploring the sites in Yogyakarta.
Through experiential learning, the students had gained a better understanding
of the Humanities aspects of Indonesia and came back to Singapore with
stronger ties among themselves and greater appreciation towards Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>MOE History Challenge 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>The MOE History Challenge aims to help students showcase and apply their
conceptual understanding of the subject across different historical periods.
Two of our AI gentlemen were offered positions in MOE's History Talent
Development Programme!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Our students went through a rigorous selection process in August, in the
form of a nationwide challenge that consisted of 3 sections, multiple-choice,
short answer and open-ended questions. These questions were attempted individually
via SLS. Questions asked during this challenge were mostly outside of what
they learn in the curriculum and designed to seek out students who can
think analytically and critically with regards to the subject discipline.
We would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to our two AI gentlemen
for applying their critical thinking skills beyond the classroom:</p>
<p>RION OH YU BIN (3-E2)
<br>WONG ZHONG XIAN JOSH (3-E2)</p>
<p><strong>National Youth Environment Conference 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>At the National Youth Environment Conference (NYEC) this year, our students
put on their thinking hats and critical thinking lenses to research on
one of three topics related to the environment: sustainable energy amidst
climate change, sustainable water management and sustainable transport
in cities. They each adopted the perspectives of different countries such
as Germany, Nepal, Turkey and Singapore to present their position papers
at a conference styled very closely to the United Nations’ model.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>A heartiest congratulations to Sankar Gowri from 3E1 who won the best
position paper for her critical insights on water conservation in Singapore.
Gowri has learnt that even simple actions like having a shorter shower
time or using a mug of water while brushing your teeth instead of leaving
the tap open can create a major difference. Through this experience, students
expanded their knowledge of global environment issues and showcased their
communication skills as they worked with fellow delegates from different
countries to come up with feasible solutions that will benefit the world.</p>

<p><strong>Raffles Model United Nations Conference 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>Four of our students took up the challenge of participating in the prestigious
Raffles Model United Nations (RMUN) this year with the theme of ‘Discord
under Heaven’. They worked in pairs as double delegates, representing the
countries of Korea and Germany in the issues of the Myanmar coup and Crimean
crisis respectively. Through this experience, our students reflected on
the increasing tumult faced by established political orders and how recent
foreign policy decisions have irreversibly changed geopolitics, as well
as the possible solutions that might emerge in response to such adversity.
They also had the exclusive experience of learning from an expert sharing
session by retired Singapore diplomat Mr Bilahari Kausikan. Our delegates
showed poise and eloquence when presenting their views and we were very
proud to have them representing the school!</p>

<p><strong>Founders' Memorial Day 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2022, selected Secondary 2 students participated in the Student Archivist
Oral History Project. Working in groups, students conducted interviews
to find out more about what healthcare was like in Singapore from the 1950s
to 1980s. Through the stories and memories of their interviewees, students
grew to better understand the challenges, beliefs and values of our founding
fathers that helped shape SIngapore to what it is today.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>We are proud to share that the oral history interview for one of our teams
was selected for a professional film production! Keep a lookout for their
video at various museums and at the upcoming Founders’ Memorial at Gardens
by the Bay.</p>
