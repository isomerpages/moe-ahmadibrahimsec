<p><strong>Secondary 1 Orientation Programme<br /></strong>The Student Leaders ease new Secondary 1 students into the new secondary school environment in AI through the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme. Through games and other team-bonding activities, the student leaders provide a good overview about the history of AI, the school culture and norms, and also helped to build class spirit and school spirit in the new batch of students. The student leaders also serve as role models by exemplifying our school values to these new students.</p>

<p><strong>Quote of the week and Ordinary Miracles sharing<br /></strong>Through the termly sharing of &lsquo;Ordinary Miracles in AI&rsquo; by Student Councillors, both students and staff of AI learn about things happening in the school that are meaningful yet often overlooked. This promotes a sense of gratitude in both staff and students and increases the awareness of the many positive aspects of school life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weekly sharing of a &lsquo;Quote of the Week&rsquo; by Student Councillors, encourages students to display our school values, by relating one of our school values with current school events or activities.</p>

<p><strong>Student feedback and school improvement projects<br /></strong>The Student Council serves as a channel between the student body and the school management. Working closely with the Class Leaders, the Student Councillors gather feedback from the student body. They consider multiple perspectives and differing viewpoints before organising the feedback obtained and presenting them to the School Principal at a dialogue session. This Student Voice Project has led to actual school improvement initiatives and has built student leaders who have greater sensitivity to areas of concerns of their peers and the school. The success of the project motivated the Student Council to continue to find new ways to engage the student body in improving their secondary school experience.</p>

<p><strong>Teachers&rsquo; Day Celebration<br /></strong>As individuals who are innovative and enthusiastic, the Student Councillors also continually challenge themselves in generating new ideas in the implementation of major school events such as the annual Teachers&rsquo; Day celebrations. With the help of other student leader groups, the Student Councillors work hard to coordinate class appreciation activities and a memorable concert for their teachers on Teachers&rsquo; Day.</p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Image%209_Teachers%20Day.jpg" />
<p><strong>Service Learning workshops and service learning at VWOs<br /></strong>The Student Councillors are involved in a Service Learning workshop each year, where they learn about community needs and the design thinking process behind the planning of a service learning project. These workshops lead to a student-planned service learning project to serve selected Volunteer Welfare Organisations such as SWAMI Home, Lions Befrienders and MINDS.</p>
<img src="/images/sl2.png">
<p><strong>External workshops and leadership convention</strong><br />Beyond their involvement within the school, representatives from the Student Council also take part in external workshops and leadership convention (e.g. Chong Pang Youth Communication and Leadership workshop and Hwa Chong Student Leader Convention). These students learn and interact with student leaders of other schools and improve on their leadership skills, before consolidating their learning and sharing what they learn with their peers in school.</p>
