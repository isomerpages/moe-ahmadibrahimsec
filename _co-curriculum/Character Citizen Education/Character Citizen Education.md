<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education (NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.</p>
<p>Serving as a broader foundation for the holistic development of students, the school utilizes the progressive and spiraling curriculum strategy in the enactment of CCE lessons and student development experiences (SDEs) to impart the “AI RISE (Resilience, Integrity, Steadfastness, Excellence) with Care, Courage and Gratitude”, the school values that are embodied by Encik Ahmad Ibrahim. Through the inculcation of these values, the school envisions the development of the “AI Thinker” who can utilise their cognitive skills and experiences to become active and responsible individuals to their families, communities, the nation, and beyond.</p>

<li>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</li>
<li>The goals of Sexuality Education are to:<br />(i) To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;<br />(ii) To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and<br />(iii) To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about sexuality.</li>
<li>The key messages of Sexuality Education are:<br />(i) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;<br />(ii) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);<br />(iii)Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and<br />(iv) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.<br /><br />You may click&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/sexuality-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>&nbsp;for more information on MOE Sexuality Education.</li>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF AHMAD IBRAHIM SECONDARY SCHOOL&rsquo;S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2021</strong></p>

<p>i. &ldquo;The Teenage Years (2nd Edition)&rdquo; (Lower Sec) Teaching &amp; Learning resource package<br />ii. &ldquo;Sense &amp; Sexuality (2nd Edition)&rdquo; (Upper Sec) Teaching &amp; Learning resource package&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 &ndash; 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one&rsquo;s ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Through &ldquo;The Teenage Years&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sense &amp; Sexuality&rdquo; packages, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</li>

<p><em>eTeens</em>&nbsp;is a programme developed by Health Promotion Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, for Secondary 3 and secondary 4 students to provide them with accurate information on STIs, HIV and protection from a health perspective.&nbsp;<em>eTeens&nbsp;</em>is conducted in two segments &ndash; a mass talk segment and a classroom-based programme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u></u>Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens&nbsp;</em>programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.<u></u></p>

<p>Being named after Encik Ahmad Ibrahim serves as a reminder and an inspiration for all students and staffs to emulate his qualities of determination, courage, integrity and service. The Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme provides a great platform for educators to nurture in our students the same spirit of community service that Encik Ahmad Ibrahim had. Covid-19 situation this year has changed almost everything but it has not changed our passion of wanting to serve and contribute back to the society.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schools went into full Home-based Learning (HBL) in Term 1 where the form teachers could only meet their form class students through online platforms like zoom and google meet. Riding on that new norm and momentum, CCE department brought service learning to a next higher level &ndash; virtual. Safe-distancing Service Learning during Covid-19 is still possible as students will now apply their communication skills and knowledge to address community needs. Entirely student-initiated, students did a needs analysis to find out about the various community groups that need help. The class then decided which community service project to take up.</p>
<p>Because of the pandemic, the classes could not gather like the past to discuss, but it was great because they found other means to reach out to one another and they could do it at their own time. This pandemic allowed students the opportunities to expand their knowledge on social issues and responsibilities as they learned that they could also play a part to help. Many classes did video and performance to show their gratitude and appreciation to the frontline warriors. Their learning is amplified and deeper civil engagement is fostered.</p>
