<h2>Track &amp; Field</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Track and Field is an all rounded CCA consisting of Run, Jump and Throws.
All of it requires Resilience, Determination and Commitment. It is an individual
sport unlike other sports CCA and hence u win through your own efforts.
We are like a big family, motivating each other through hardships and caring
for one another. Track and Field also puts hard work and a positive attitude
first. We have fun during trainings but at the same time we maintain discipline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our motto is,&nbsp;<strong>“Chase your dreams, throw your worries, jump for your goals”</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Track and Field has definitely helped me to become fitter. It encourages me to persevere through the difficult trainings. I am able to use the values I acquired from Track and Field in many real life situations. I believe the bonds that I have with my Track and Field friends have grown, especially when running together, as we get to talk to each other and help one another out. For example, once my friend got really bad cramps in his thighs and calves, and my group of friends went to help him out. This exemplifies the value of care, one of our school values."</em>

<p>Activities</p>
<p>The determination of the track and field members during the Nationals
Track and Field Finals was electrifying. The AI Track and Field team did
the school proud by qualifying as one of the top 8 finalists! They stayed
focused amidst the shouts from the boisterous crowd that was trying to
outdo one another with their cheers to set the track ablaze. Their tenacity
could be felt right up the stands, where the team cheered them on with
all their might.</p>
<p>This sense of camaraderie would not have been possible if not for the
student-led camps, which not only focused on preparation for the Nationals,
but also focused on team building. Often known as an individual sport,
the students never let their individual goals get in the way of building
great friendships. They would support each other’s races by cheering for
them, even on the days where they did not have any events. They would also
form study groups and this transcended streams, cementing their friendship.</p>
<p>May the AI School Flag continue to fly proudly!&nbsp;</p>
