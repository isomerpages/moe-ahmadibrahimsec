<h2>Basketball</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>At AISS Basketball, we believe in going All In with our Spirit Strong.
We are committed to developing every player to reach their full potential,
both on and off the court. Players have opportunities to analyse game statistics,
develop practical game organisation skills, and take on leadership roles
within the team. Players can also contribute to fitness programmes, ensuring
the team stays in peak condition, and participate in publicity and outreach
efforts to showcase team activities and achievements.</p>
<p>Every session, drill, and game is an opportunity to learn, improve, and
support one another. We focus on building skills and discipline, fostering
teamwork, and nurturing leaders who are confident, resilient, and ready
to rise to any challenge on the court of life.</p>
