<p>The AI Girl Guides grooms the students as they go through a rigorous programme
aimed at inculcating values and qualities required in the 21st Century.
Via team building in small group based activities, our Guides are inducted
in a gamut of courses that prepare them to be useful and responsible citizens
of the world.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;AI Girl Guides are a group of enthusiastic and friendly young
ladies who live up to&nbsp;their promise and motto “Be Prepared”. The motto
requires them to be well-prepared&nbsp;and&nbsp;to be ready for any situations
that may happen during our trainings and duties that&nbsp;are entrusted
to them. It drives them to be the best they can be, developing their values&nbsp;such&nbsp;as
taking the initiative, having a sense of urgency and being responsible
and&nbsp;discipline.&nbsp;As much as the basic activities for uniformed
groups are conducted every&nbsp;week,&nbsp;we do our best to expose our
guides to different skills and learning opportunities&nbsp;each&nbsp;year.
The friendship the girls have with one another is what keeps them bonded
as&nbsp;they&nbsp;learn to take care of one another. The girls also look
forward to the combined camp&nbsp;with scouts each year as well as the
annual cookies sale. Girl Guides seek to nurture&nbsp;these&nbsp;young
ladies&nbsp;to grow up to be strong women in the future. The girls are
proud to&nbsp;belong&nbsp;to this group where care, support and friendliness
are what unite them all&nbsp;together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"Being the company leader of Girl Guides was one of my greatest achievement in my secondary school life. COVID-19 had taken away the opportunity for me to lead the company physically. However, through e-CCA, it had taught me to be patient and have the courage to lead. It had also taught me how to communicate with my fellow leaders, strengthening our bond with one another. Even though it was tough to balance my studies and CCA responsibilities at the same time, I have never regretted being the Company Leader."</em>

<p>Mission</p>
<p>Our motto “Be Prepared” means that a guide should be ready for any kind
of duty that may thrust upon them, and what is more, to know what to do
by having practised it beforehand in the case of any accident or any kind
of work that they may be asked to take up.</p>

<p>Activities</p>
<p>“Here are some barbecued marshmallows for you!” One of the Girl Guides
beamed with pride as she served the curious Secondary 1 students hovering
around the Girl Guide’s booth at the CCA Carnival. The students were also
shown past year achievements and photos of activities such as outdoor cooking
and Training Camp held at the Girl Guides Headquarters. Confidence and
pride were written on the guides’ faces as they put their beloved CCA on
display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Sree Narayana Mission Home (SNMH) in Yishun, smiles broke out on
the faces of elderly residents playing games such as ball catching and
word guessing organised by the guides. These Values-in-Action activities
develop in the AI girl guide a heart for the community and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Good service begins with great attitude. The AI girl guides are ever ready
to render their assistance to the school with pride and positivity. Be
it the post-Achievement Day dinner or the post-Secondary 1 Orientation
dinner, they take pride in serving food and drinks to the guests. Their
commendable level of service and graciousness is indeed a source of pride
for the school.</p>
