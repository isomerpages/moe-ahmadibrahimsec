<p>St. John Brigade Singapore (SJBS) upholds the mottos ‘Pro Fide’ and ‘Pro
Utilitate Hominum’, which stands for ‘For The Faith’ and ‘For The Service
Of Mankind’ respectively. Our corps seeks to train and develop cadets into
confident, reliable and clear-headed leaders who contributes to the school
and community actively. We offer a wide variety of programmes that equip
cadets with life-saving skills such as First-Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation
Of Casualties (TOC) and Footdrill. Our cadets participates actively in
the Annual Hospital Attachment, Annual Walkathon, and Flag Day. Our cadets
also partake in leadership training programmes such as the Zone Non-Commissioned
Officer Course (NCOC) and Corps Trainer Course (CTC) which helps improve
cadets’ leadership skills and broaden their way of thinking. With the Cadet
Proficiency Badge Scheme (CPBS), cadets are able to gain other skills through
different types of enriching courses and obtain different badges such as
Leadership, Nursing Care, Shooting, Heart Saver and many more.</p>

<p><em>“Being a part of SJAB has imparted invaluable lessons, particularly in taking initiative and leading. These skills have greatly contributed to my growth, making me a more confident and outgoing person. I am now more receptive to new experiences. The challenges I encountered in the CCA have instilled in me the values of resilience and excellence. I have learned to persevere and always strive for the best. I am deeply grateful to my corps and officers, whose support has been instrumental in my journey. SJAB has truly become a second home to me.”</em>

<p><em>“Joining SJAB has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my school life. The district and brigade events are not only fun but also provide a unique opportunity to forge lifelong friendships. Through SJAB, I have learned essential skills such as first aid and home nursing, which are invaluable in everyday life. Although the CCA can be challenging, the unwavering support and camaraderie from my platoonmates and district friends make it all worthwhile. Together, we face challenges and grow, always ensuring we have each other's backs."</em>

<p><strong>CCA Open House</strong> 
<br>Over the course of a few days in January, AISJ had CCA carnival and CCA
exposure for our fellow secondary 1 students. They got to try out some
key components of St John like CPR, bandaging, transportation of casualty
and casualty simulations. Students also get to learn how to do special
effects make-up to simulate real injuries.
