<p>St. John Brigade Singapore (SJBS) upholds the mottos ‘Pro Fide’ and ‘Pro
Utilitate Hominum’, which stands for ‘For The Faith’ and ‘For The Service
Of Mankind’ respectively. Our corps seeks to train and develop cadets into
confident, reliable and clear-headed leaders who contributes to the school
and community actively. We offer a wide variety of programmes that equip
cadets with life-saving skills such as First-Aid, Home Nursing, Transportation
Of Casualties (TOC) and Footdrill. Our cadets participates actively in
the Annual Hospital Attachment, Annual Walkathon, and Flag Day. Our cadets
also partake in leadership training programmes such as the Zone Non-Commissioned
Officer Course (NCOC) and Corps Trainer Course (CTC) which helps improve
cadets’ leadership skills and broaden their way of thinking. With the Cadet
Proficiency Badge Scheme (CPBS), cadets are able to gain other skills through
different types of enriching courses and obtain different badges such as
Leadership, Nursing Care, Shooting, Heart Saver and many more.</p>

<p><em>“Being a part of SJAB has imparted invaluable lessons, particularly in taking initiative and leading. These skills have greatly contributed to my growth, making me a more confident and outgoing person. I am now more receptive to new experiences. The challenges I encountered in the CCA have instilled in me the values of resilience and excellence. I have learned to persevere and always strive for the best. I am deeply grateful to my corps and officers, whose support has been instrumental in my journey. SJAB has truly become a second home to me.” </em>

<p><em>“Joining SJAB has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my school life. The district and brigade events are not only fun but also provide a unique opportunity to forge lifelong friendships. Through SJAB, I have learned essential skills such as first aid and home nursing, which are invaluable in everyday life. Although the CCA can be challenging, the unwavering support and camaraderie from my platoonmates and district friends make it all worthwhile. Together, we face challenges and grow, always ensuring we have each other's backs."</em>

<p>“Again, Ladies!” shouted the Company Sergeant Major. “We have to try harder!
Come on! We need to win this for our school!” With sweat dripping off their
foreheads and the look of sheer determination on the cadets’ faces, they
shouted in unison, “Yes, Ma’am!” After dozens of rehearsals later, a satisfied
smile was etched on the instructor’s face.</p>
<p>“Come on, gentlemen! You can do better than this! We have to show them
how AI cadets evacuate the injured casualties!” The Ambulance cadets then
attempted the drill again, a look of absolute grit on their faces.</p>
<p>It was the moment of truth. The auditorium was enveloped in an uncanny
silence as the crowd waited with bated breath for the announcer to reveal
the results of the 2017 Zonal First Aid competition. This prestigious competition
pits the best in the zone against each other and the winners will represent
the Zone in the National First Aid Competition. “Best Leader and Best Foot
Drill go to the Nursing Cadets of Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary!” The crowd applauded
with gusto and loud cheers! “Best Transport of Casualty – The Ambulance
Brigade of Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary!” The AI cadets took a deep breath and
closed their eyes, knowing all those months of sweat and tears have finally
paid off. They had done it!</p>
