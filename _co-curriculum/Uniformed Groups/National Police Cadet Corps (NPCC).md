<p>Set up in 1968, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School’s NPCC unit has grown in
strength in the last 50 years. AISS NPCC unit aims to develop its members
as a confident, self-directed learner, an active contributor and a concerned
citizen through the wide range of activities.</p>
<p>Our cadets pick up skills such as foot drills, armed drills, campcraft,
and revolver shooting. Alongside these, sing-a-long sessions, physical
training, recreational activities and lectures are held to train them mentally
and physically. Values such as endurance and teamwork are instilled into
the cadets while learning these skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our cadets also have the opportunity of going on overseas educational
trips to places such as Hong Kong and Brunei, through the linkup between
SPF/NPCC HQ and our foreign partner’s police cadet groups. Locally, we
also have our annual camps in the unit held in school.</p>

<p>Due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, this has allowed cadets to
attend various NPCC activities throughout the year. Cadets were given various
opportunities to attend learning journeys to police establishments such
as Police Heritage Centre and visits to Yishun Neighbourhood Police Centre,
Area Camps and participate in NPCC-related competitions such as the inter-unit
Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) Competition, in which our unit placed 8th
among the 123 participating schools. As AI NPCC continues to strive despite
of all the challenges and obstacles, let’s aim for more remarkable accomplishments
and reaching new heights together. Onwards, AI NPCC!

<blockquote>
<p><em>“As I reflect, I was glad that I joined NPCC. NPCC made me realized how capable I am of being a leader and the importance of having self-discipline. Through all the trainings, NPCC taught me how to be confident leader and believe that it is fine to make mistakes as it is part of the process. I was given various opportunities to lead and guide others and I appreciate all these learning experiences that has truly shaped me to who I am today!” </em>
