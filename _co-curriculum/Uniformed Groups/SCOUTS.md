<p>Ahmad Ibrahim Warrior Scouts has been active since 1967. We have been achieving the Gold Frank Cooper Sands Award for the past 13 years. The Frank Cooper Sands Award is an award that every scout unit in Singapore strives to achieve excellence in.</p>
<p>As for our CCA, we normally have 2 days of CCA per week in which we organize many exciting and enriching activities for our scouts. Some examples of the skills that you will acquire through scouting are outdoor cooking, knot tying, pioneering, orienteering, drills, first-aid and exploration. We also organize games during some of our CCA days to add on to the element of fun for our scouts.</p>
<p>We occasionally hold inter-unit competitions in which scouts from other units can participate in. Likewise, we also participate in some competitions organized by other scout units. Furthermore, we also attend campfires held by other scout units. These campfires are a form of celebration for scouts of different units to gather and have fun together. To do our part to contribute to the society, we actively participate in national scouting activities such as our annual Jobweek and Donation Draw. Not only have that, but we also occasionally organized service learning activities. These are some examples of how you will get to serve the community through scouting.</p>
<p>Each year we organise a minimum of 2 camps. One will be held during the June holidays while one will be held during the end of year holidays. At times, we also hold combined CCA days with the Girl Guides. This is to allow our scouts to bond with and learn more about members from a different CCA. In addition, we also organise overseas exchange trips for our scouts to learn more about scouts from other countries while, having fun overseas. Some of our scouts are also presented with the honourable opportunity to participate in the National Day Parade on the Floating Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some values that an AI Warrior scout will learn through scouting are leadership, discipline, brotherhood, integrity, excellence and teamwork. All the tasks that our scouts are required to accomplish will instill these values upon them, along with physical fitness as they will also be given opportunities to explore excellence there in physical capabilities. Through scouting, you will learn to break boundaries and move out of your comfort zone. Our primary objective is for our scouts to be shaped into more responsible and resilient individuals as they experience scouting.</p>

<p><p>In Scouting, Scouts learn four core skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camping which includes Campfire</li>
<li>Hiking, Exploration and Orienteering</li>
<li>Knots and Pioneering</li>
<li>Cooking and Outdoor Survival</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done through the eight elements of the Scout Method:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Scout Promise and Law</li>
<li>Learning By Doing</li>
<li>Personal Progression</li>
<li>Patrol or Team System</li>
<li>Adult Support</li>
<li>Symbolic Framework</li>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Community Involvement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="camping">Camping</h3>
<p>Scouts’ hands are trained for wonders, with the ability to set up tents and structures necessary for surviving in the outdoors. Working in accordance with nature, Scouts improvise and make use of their surroundings to meet their needs while protecting them.</p>
<h3 id="orienteering">Orienteering</h3>
<p>Navigating with a map in one hand and a compass in the other, Scouts identify checkpoints and significant landmarks, and orientate themselves based on these points, allowing them to explore unfamiliar territory with ease while hiking.</p>
<h3 id="pioneering">Pioneering</h3>
<p>With nimble fingers and rugged hands, Scouts construct miniature wooden models, transforming them into life-sized bridges, swings and kitchens using mere wooden spars and manila ropes.</p>
<h3 id="outdoor-cooking">Outdoor Cooking</h3>
<p>From sourcing dried leaves and twigs, to building and maintaining a fire, to putting small pieces of chicken to roast over a self-made cooking pit, this is part of the outdoor cooking skill set that every Scout possesses.</p>
