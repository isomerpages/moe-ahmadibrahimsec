## National Cadet Corps (Land)
### About Us

<img src="/images/ncclogo.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

The National Cadet Corps (Land) in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School is a Uniformed Group Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that is supported by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Education (MOE), and it is one of the largest youth uniformed groups in Singapore.

The AISS NCC Unit centres its programmes on the 'Cadet Strong' framework, where all NCC cadets are 'Cadet Strong', with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. The training syllabus includes general military knowledge, as well as adventure training and leadership development. The integration of land, air and sea programmes is emphasised to enable NCC cadets to enjoy activities that encompass the three elements. In addition, to promote the quest for excellence and inculcate the spirit of participation and sportsmanship amongst the cadets, competitions are included as part of the training curriculum. NCC cadets are also engaged in community service, so as to help develop their sense of social responsibility.

<p>Our trainings consist of classroom lessons, individual field craft lessons (IFC), Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and/or Free-style Drill (FSD) trainings, physical training and sports and games. Annual camps, such as the Leadership camp and Unit camp are designed to allow for student ownership over their training activities and to develop the leadership competencies of the cadets.
<br><br>
Apart from our school activities, we leverage on the activities conducted by HQ NCC as well â€“ such as Camp FORGE for the Junior Cadets, Camp STEEL for the Senior Cadets and the Specialist Course for the Cadet Leaders.
Other key programmes include the Air-Rifle experiential shooting experiences for the Senior Cadets to prepare them for their live range shooting experience as Cadet Leaders. Immersive overseas exposure and experiential opportunities are given to cadets who demonstrate outstanding commitment and dedication to the corps.</p>
