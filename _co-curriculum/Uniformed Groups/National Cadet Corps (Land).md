</div>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (Land) in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School is a
Uniformed Group Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) that is supported by the Ministry
of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Education (MOE), and it is one of the
largest youth uniformed groups in Singapore.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The AISS NCC Unit centres its programmes on the 'Cadet Strong' framework,
where all NCC cadets are 'Cadet Strong', with a resilient mind, fit body
and committed heart. The training syllabus includes general military knowledge,
as well as adventure training and leadership development. The integration
of land, air and sea programmes is emphasised to enable NCC cadets to enjoy
activities that encompass the three elements. In addition, to promote the
quest for excellence and inculcate the spirit of participation and sportsmanship
amongst the cadets, competitions are included as part of the training curriculum.
NCC cadets are also engaged in community service, so as to help develop
their sense of social responsibility.</p>

<p>Our trainings consist of classroom lessons, individual field craft lessons
(IFC), Precision Drill Squad (PDS) and/or Free-style Drill (FSD) trainings,
physical training and sports and games. Annual camps, such as the Leadership
camp and Unit camp are designed to allow for student ownership over their
training activities and to develop the leadership competencies of the cadets.
<br>
<br>Apart from our school activities, we leverage on the activities conducted
by HQ NCC as well – such as Camp FORGE for the Junior Cadets, Camp STEEL
for the Senior Cadets and the Specialist Course for the Cadet Leaders.
Other key programmes include the Air-Rifle experiential shooting experiences
for the Senior Cadets to prepare them for their live range shooting experience
as Cadet Leaders. Immersive overseas exposure and experiential opportunities
are given to cadets who demonstrate outstanding commitment and dedication
to the corps.</p>
