## Scouts
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/scout%20logo.jpg">

Ahmad Ibrahim Warriors Scout Group has been active since 1967. We envision each Scout to be a gentleman clean in thought, word and deed, who strives to be a student leader and who is a cut above the rest. As individual Scouts, we work towards the Chief Commissioner’s Award which is conferred to the most outstanding and distinctive Scouts in recognition of their exemplary performance, dedication as well as services at the secondary school level. As a unit, we have been achieving the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) Award for sixteen consecutive years. The Frank Cooper Sands Award is an award which every Scout unit in Singapore strives to achieve excellence in.

In Scouts CCA, we conduct training twice a week where Scouts experience many exciting and enriching activities and learn Scouting skills such as camping, pioneering, orienteering and outdoor cooking. We also organise physical training during training to improve the fitness of Scouts and team-bonding games to further add the element of fun for Scouts.

We organise inter-unit and inter-patrol competitions like Scout Lore Quest and cooking challenge to hone our Scouting knowledge and skills. Similarly, we also participate in courses, competitions and events like the Scout Leadership Training Course, Patrol Pioneering Challenge and Founder's Day Celebration organised by the North Area of the Singapore Scout Association. Furthermore, we also gather around campfires with Scouts from other units to celebrate achievements together and to forge stronger camaraderie. 

To do our part for society, we organise and participate in service-learning activities. We also raise funds during the annual Job Week to support Scout programmes and activities. In Job Week, Scouts take to the homes of residents all over Singapore to do jobs like cleaning, gardening, and tutoring, so as to learn the dignity of labour, value of honest work and belief in helping others. As a result, Scouts can be developed into self-reliant, confident, responsible, and active citizens. 

Each year, we organise two camps, one in March and the other in June. Once every two years at year end, we co-organise a combined camp with the Girl Guides and embark on an overseas camping trip to meet Scouts from other countries. This is to allow Scouts to make new friends and learn new knowledge and skills from our counterparts.

<p></p><p>In Scouting, Scouts learn four core skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camping which includes Campfire</li>
<li>Hiking, Exploration and Orienteering</li>
<li>Knots and Pioneering</li>
<li>Cooking and Outdoor Survival</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done through the eight elements of the Scout Method:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Scout Promise and Law</li>
<li>Learning By Doing</li>
<li>Personal Progression</li>
<li>Patrol or Team System</li>
<li>Adult Support</li>
<li>Symbolic Framework</li>
<li>Nature</li>
<li>Community Involvement</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="camping">Camping</h3>
<p>Scouts’ hands are trained for wonders, with the ability to set up tents and structures necessary for surviving in the outdoors. Working in accordance with nature, Scouts improvise and make use of their surroundings to meet their needs while protecting them.</p>
<h3 id="orienteering">Orienteering</h3>
<p>Navigating with a map in one hand and a compass in the other, Scouts identify checkpoints and significant landmarks, and orientate themselves based on these points, allowing them to explore unfamiliar territory with ease while hiking.</p>
<h3 id="orienteering">Pioneering</h3>
<p>With nimble fingers and rugged hands, Scouts construct miniature wooden models, transforming them into life-sized bridges, swings and kitchens using mere wooden spars and manila ropes.</p>
<h3 id="outdoor-cooking">Outdoor Cooking</h3>
<p>From sourcing dried leaves and twigs, to building and maintaining a fire, to putting small pieces of chicken to roast over a self-made cooking pit, this is part of the outdoor cooking skill set that every Scout possesses.</p>
