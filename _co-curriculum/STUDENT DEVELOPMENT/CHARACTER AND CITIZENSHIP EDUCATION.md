<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>AI&rsquo;s CCE programme is anchored in our core values of RISE (Resilience, Integrity, Steadfastness, Excellence) with Care, Courage and Gratitude. AI believes that every student is capable of achieving the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE), namely, a Self-directed Learner, a Confident Person, an Active Contributor and a Concerned Citizen.</p>
<p>The CCE programme facilitates social-emotional learning (SEL) and develops the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competences (21CC) in our students. We believe in fostering strong teacher-student relationships (TSR). Our whole-school approach towards CCE is implemented through the following platforms:</p>

<p><strong><u>CCE Lessons and School-based Programmes<br /></u></strong>The weekly CCE lessons focus on addressing the social and emotional needs of the students. Form Teacher Time (FT Time) provides a safe and caring platform for Circle Time,<br />1-to-1 Conferencing, Breakfast with FTs and AI Student Journaling to promote positive TSR and character development.</p>
<p>The Leadership module engages students in development of self-leadership and connecting well with others to build meaningful relationships. Our school commemorates Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day as part of the National Education.</p>
<p>Other school-based programmes such as weekly assembly, Outdoor Learning Experience as Learning for Life Programme (OLE-LLP), Critical Social Inquiry as Applied Learning Programme (CSI-ALP) and CCA support values education and character development.</p>
<p><strong><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)<br /></u></strong>ECG aims to equip all students with the knowledge and skills in charting their post-secondary education and career path. VAK profiling was done in the beginning of the Secondary 1 and 3 years so that students can capitalise on their learning styles for effective learning. Career Talks are also organised for Secondary 1 to 3 students so that they can listen to and interact with professionals to find out more about their careers. Normal stream students also take part in Elective Modules to learn more about different career sectors. In addition, Secondary 3 students can take part in Advance Elective Modules (AEMs), Elective Modules (EMs) and Work Experience Programme (WEP).</p>
<p>An in-house ECG Fair is organised for graduating students annually where Institutes of Higher Learning such as the Polytechnics, ITEs and JCs set up booths to provide consultation to the students. In addition, a Resume Writing and Interview Skills workshop is organised to prepare students for DSA-JC and Early Admission Exercise (EAE) to Polytechnics. Graduating students also attend Course-Advising Programme to find out more about Polytechnic courses. All graduating students take part in the post-secondary options exercise (PSOE) which is a mock exercise to teach them how to choose their options based on interest, ability and past-year cut-off points (COPs).</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education (SEd)<br /></u></strong>Sexuality Education is conducted by a group of trained teachers. For more information, please click '<strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>' tab.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cyber-wellness (CW)<br /></u></strong>The cyber-wellness curriculum aims to equip AI students with the knowledge, skills and the correct netiquette to become responsible netizens. Topics include Online Privacy, Online Relationships, Cyber Bullying, Online Identity, and Handling Online Content. In addition, in collaboration with the ICT Department, a Cyber-wellness Exhibition is held at the end of the year. Secondary 2 students work in teams to prepare presentations to explain the importance of Cyber-wellness to Secondary 1 to 3 peers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Service Learning<br /></u></strong>Facilitated by Form Teachers, students actively participate in a thoughtfully organised service that is conducted in, and meets the needs of a community. Through Service Learning, students learn values such as resilience, integrity, care, courage and gratitude. They also acquire skills such as conflict management, time management and teamwork.</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes focus on school improvement and environmental education projects. The Upper Secondary classes identify the needs of the different groups of people in the community and reach out to them. The 9-week structured Service Learning lessons culminates in the Community Day held at the end of Term 1. Some examples are shown below. In addition, CCA groups provides opportunities for students to participate in Values-in-Action activities.</p>
