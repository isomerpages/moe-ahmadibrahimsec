<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>AI&rsquo;s CCE programme is anchored in our core values of RISE (Resilience, Integrity, Steadfastness, Excellence) with Care, Courage and Gratitude. AI believes that every student is capable of achieving the Desired Outcomes of Education (DOE), namely, a Self-directed Learner, a Confident Person, an Active Contributor and a Concerned Citizen.</p>
<p>The CCE programme facilitates social-emotional learning (SEL) and develops the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century competences (21CC) in our students. We believe in fostering strong teacher-student relationships (TSR). Our whole-school approach towards CCE is implemented through the following platforms:</p>

<div>
<p><strong><u>CCE Lessons and School-based Programmes<br /></u></strong>The weekly CCE lessons focus on addressing the social and emotional needs of the students. Form Teacher Time (FT Time) provides a safe and caring platform for Circle Time,<br />1-to-1 Conferencing, Breakfast with FTs and AI Student Journaling to promote positive TSR and character development.</p>
<p>The Leadership module engages students in development of self-leadership and connecting well with others to build meaningful relationships. Our school commemorates Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day as part of the National Education.</p>
<p>Other school-based programmes such as weekly assembly, Outdoor Learning Experience as Learning for Life Programme (OLE-LLP), Critical Social Inquiry as Applied Learning Programme (CSI-ALP) and CCA support values education and character development.</p>
<p><strong><u>Education and Career Guidance (ECG)<br /></u></strong>ECG aims to equip all students with the knowledge and skills in charting their post-secondary education and career path. VAK profiling was done in the beginning of the Secondary 1 and 3 years so that students can capitalise on their learning styles for effective learning. Career Talks are also organised for Secondary 1 to 3 students so that they can listen to and interact with professionals to find out more about their careers. Normal stream students also take part in Elective Modules to learn more about different career sectors. In addition, Secondary 3 students can take part in Advance Elective Modules (AEMs), Elective Modules (EMs) and Work Experience Programme (WEP).</p>
<p>An in-house ECG Fair is organised for graduating students annually where Institutes of Higher Learning such as the Polytechnics, ITEs and JCs set up booths to provide consultation to the students. In addition, a Resume Writing and Interview Skills workshop is organised to prepare students for DSA-JC and Early Admission Exercise (EAE) to Polytechnics. Graduating students also attend Course-Advising Programme to find out more about Polytechnic courses. All graduating students take part in the post-secondary options exercise (PSOE) which is a mock exercise to teach them how to choose their options based on interest, ability and past-year cut-off points (COPs).</p>
<p><strong><u>Sexuality Education (SEd)<br /></u></strong>Sexuality Education is conducted by a group of trained teachers. For more information, please click '<strong>MOE Sexuality Education in Schools</strong>' tab.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cyber-wellness (CW)<br /></u></strong>The cyber-wellness curriculum aims to equip AI students with the knowledge, skills and the correct netiquette to become responsible netizens. Topics include Online Privacy, Online Relationships, Cyber Bullying, Online Identity, and Handling Online Content. In addition, in collaboration with the ICT Department, a Cyber-wellness Exhibition is held at the end of the year. Secondary 2 students work in teams to prepare presentations to explain the importance of Cyber-wellness to Secondary 1 to 3 peers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Service Learning<br /></u></strong>Facilitated by Form Teachers, students actively participate in a thoughtfully organised service that is conducted in, and meets the needs of a community. Through Service Learning, students learn values such as resilience, integrity, care, courage and gratitude. They also acquire skills such as conflict management, time management and teamwork.</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary classes focus on school improvement and environmental education projects. The Upper Secondary classes identify the needs of the different groups of people in the community and reach out to them. The 9-week structured Service Learning lessons culminates in the Community Day held at the end of Term 1. Some examples are shown below. In addition, CCA groups provides opportunities for students to participate in Values-in-Action activities.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.</li>
<li>The goals of Sexuality Education are to:<br />(i) To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate&nbsp;<u>knowledge</u>&nbsp;on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;<br />(ii) To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of&nbsp;<u>social and emotional skills</u>&nbsp;of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and<br />(iii) To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of <u>positive mainstream values and attitudes</u> about sexuality.</li>
<li>The key messages of Sexuality Education are:<br />(i) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;<br />(ii) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);<br />(iii)Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and<br />(iv) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.<br /><br />You may click&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/sexuality-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>&nbsp;for more information on MOE Sexuality Education.</li>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW OF AHMAD IBRAHIM SECONDARY SCHOOL&rsquo;S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2021</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health, Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/programmes/sexuality-education/scope-and-teaching-approach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong> for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education in the school curriculum.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:<br />a. Science<br />b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</li>
</ol>

<div>
<p>i. &ldquo;The Teenage Years (2nd Edition)&rdquo; (Lower Sec) Teaching &amp; Learning resource package<br />ii. &ldquo;Sense &amp; Sexuality (2nd Edition)&rdquo; (Upper Sec) Teaching &amp; Learning resource package&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The values and attitudes of our youth towards sexuality are increasingly shaped by their peers, exposure to the media, popular culture and the internet. Adolescence is a complex stage in life as the adolescent attempts to find his/her own identity and often struggles with new social relationships. The period of middle adolescence (generally from 15 &ndash; 17 years old) can be a turbulent period for adolescents. The gap between physical and emotional/cognitive maturity may result in a tendency to act on impulse, experiment with various activities (including sexual activities), sometimes without understanding the unpleasant consequences that may arise from such experimentation. The need for peer acceptance can be overwhelmingly strong, and hinder one&rsquo;s ability to act responsibly. Given the pressures faced by the middle adolescent from within themselves and from peers, it is important to build a strong sense of self-worth, personal conviction and an understanding of the possible consequences of sexual behaviour.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Through &ldquo;The Teenage Years&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sense &amp; Sexuality&rdquo; packages, secondary students will have the opportunity to develop a positive self-esteem, develop their character, and expand their understanding and repertoire of skills to deal with various issues related to sexuality, which are of prime concern at this age.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><u></u>Students are taught skills such as decision-making, assertiveness and negotiation to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sex and negative peer pressure. They also learn that the impact of STIs/HIV extends beyond themselves and involves their family. Abstinence and upholding family values are the key messages. The desired outcome of the&nbsp;<em>eTeens&nbsp;</em>programme is that students are empowered to make wise, informed and sensible decisions.<u></u></p>

<p>Being named after Encik Ahmad Ibrahim serves as a reminder and an inspiration for all students and staffs to emulate his qualities of determination, courage, integrity and service. The Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme provides a great platform for educators to nurture in our students the same spirit of community service that Encik Ahmad Ibrahim had. Covid-19 situation this year has changed almost everything but it has not changed our passion of wanting to serve and contribute back to the society.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Schools went into full Home-based Learning (HBL) in Term 1 where the form teachers could only meet their form class students through online platforms like zoom and google meet. Riding on that new norm and momentum, CCE department brought service learning to a next higher level &ndash; virtual. Safe-distancing Service Learning during Covid-19 is still possible as students will now apply their communication skills and knowledge to address community needs. Entirely student-initiated, students did a needs analysis to find out about the various community groups that need help. The class then decided which community service project to take up.</p>
<p>Because of the pandemic, the classes could not gather like the past to discuss, but it was great because they found other means to reach out to one another and they could do it at their own time. This pandemic allowed students the opportunities to expand their knowledge on social issues and responsibilities as they learned that they could also play a part to help. Many classes did video and performance to show their gratitude and appreciation to the frontline warriors. Their learning is amplified and deeper civil engagement is fostered.</p>
