<h2>Chinese Orchestra</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The AICO comprises of passionate and spirited individuals who works together
hands in hands to perform melodious music pieces to entertain audiences,
in and out of school.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of our competent and seasoned instructors, AICO has
achieved the certificate of Distinction in both the 2021 and 2023 SYF Arts
Presentation and have produced many outstanding young musicians, some of
whom went on further to pursue music studies at higher institution.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide a platform for all students to learn at least one
Chinese musical instrument and to develop an appreciation for cultural
music. Our members participates at various concerts throughout the years
and are given chances to attend professional concerts at venues like the
Esplanade &amp; Singapore Conference Hall.</p>
<p>We hope to groom all-rounded youths who are passionate in the things they
do, who will persevere against the odds and who aim for perfection in the
mastery of their own instrument.</p>

<p><em>"I’ve always loved the Chinese culture and tradition, hence I was excited to know that AI has a Chinese Orchestra. No doubt, CO was my first CCA choice. I really enjoy being a CO member. On top of learning how to plays songs on the Zhongruan, I also made many friends in CO. CO provides opportunities for us to develop our music skills. It is a CCA which helps us to learn and grow."</em>

<p><em>"I learnt many skills in AICO which are applicable to my life even after I graduate from AI. Besides picking up the skill to play the yangqin, CO broadens my understanding of music and helps me to see the importance of teamwork and self-discipline. Everyone has a part to play in ensuring that the orchestra sounds harmonious and melodic. Every effort counts. I will remember this point as I take on the challenges in the future."</em>
