<h4><strong>About Us</strong></h4>
<p>Through the exploration of dance as an art form, we aim to develop each individual into confident performers, capable of expressing themselves through elegant dance movements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Dance has taught me many life values such as confidence, perseverance, and determination. Having the opportunity to plan many events, camps and leading the club as a whole, has definitely helped me improve my leadership skills too. One of the biggest take-aways that I have gained from dance is being a disciplined individual because I learnt to be a responsible person who never gives up despite challenges. Additionally, I learnt that teamwork is important as we have to work together to achieve common goals."</em><br /><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;5, 6, 7, 8!&rdquo; The dancers move tirelessly across the dance floor as they prepare to conduct a mini-workshop for the young as part of their service learning. &ldquo;Reach for your toes, but be sure to smile!&rdquo; The dancers encourage the young pre-schoolers as they reminisce the fond memories of their own journey growing as dancers.</p>
<p>Being able to move the audience is a gratifying experience for any dancer, and this is something our AI dance ensemble achieved in The Royal Dance-Off competition for the first time. They learnt that behind every stretch, every pirouette and every leap lies months of sheer hard work. A dancer is no stranger to failure, but he or she also knows that with each fall comes the opportunity to rise again, this time with more composure, tenacity and grit.</p>
