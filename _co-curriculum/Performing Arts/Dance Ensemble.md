## Dance Ensemble
### About Us
Twirl and swirl, our bodies will whirl! Through the exploration of dance as an art form, we aim to develop each individual into confident performers, capable of expressing themselves through elegant dance movements.

<blockquote>
<p><em>Dance has allowed me to blossom into a fully developed individual by teaching me new skills and providing me with experiences I never would have imagined. I learnt how to cooperate and tolerate people, how to lead, learning to think on my feet and discipline. Discipline is also a key factor in my time with dance as I have to mind how I act and when as I have to be disciplined for the dance instructors to be able to teach properly and adequately. Quick thinking is something I picked up over the years in dance, when our dance instructor relays a piece of information to us and we have to think quickly. All in all, dance has lead me a long way, and I owe the person I am today to dance.</em></p>

<p><em>“Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion.”</em></p>
<p><strong>- Martha Graham</strong></p>
<p>What is dance? Or rather, why dance?  </p>
<p>It has been said dance is the mother of the arts, for it’s the oldest of the art which reflects man’s age old need to communicate different emotions such as joy, grief, excitement, and many others. Dance simply started as man’s own life for almost all occasions, in whatever aspects, such as birth, death, healing of the sick, asking for forgiveness, war, marriage – were celebrated by dancing.</p>
<p>So AI dancers dance to express ourselves when words are insufficient. We dance to help us engrave those cherished moments. We dance to give tribute to the heroes of yesterday. Because when we dance, we can remember them a little better, feel the butterflies once again and return to the purest moments of our lives when time of no matter.</p>
