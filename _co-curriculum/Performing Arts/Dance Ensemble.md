## Dance Ensemble
### About Us
Twirl and swirl, our bodies will whirl! Through the exploration of dance as an art form, we aim to develop each individual into confident performers, capable of expressing themselves through elegant dance movements.

_"Dance has taught me many life values such as confidence, perseverance, and determination. Having the opportunity to plan many events, camps and leading the club as a whole, has definitely helped me improve my leadership skills too. One of the biggest take-aways that I have gained from dance is being a disciplined individual because I learnt to be a responsible person who never gives up despite challenges. Additionally, I learnt that teamwork is important as we have to work together to achieve common goals."_

<p><em>“Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion.”</em></p>
<p><strong>- Martha Graham</strong></p>
<p>What is dance? Or rather, why dance?  </p>
<p>It has been said dance is the mother of the arts, for it’s the oldest of the art which reflects man’s age old need to communicate different emotions such as joy, grief, excitement, and many others. Dance simply started as man’s own life for almost all occasions, in whatever aspects, such as birth, death, healing of the sick, asking for forgiveness, war, marriage – were celebrated by dancing.</p>
<p>So AI dancers dance to express ourselves when words are insufficient. We dance to help us engrave those cherished moments. We dance to give tribute to the heroes of yesterday. Because when we dance, we can remember them a little better, feel the butterflies once again and return to the purest moments of our lives when time of no matter.</p>
