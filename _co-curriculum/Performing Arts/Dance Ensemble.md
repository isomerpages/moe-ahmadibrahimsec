through elegant dance movements.</p>

<p><em>Throughout the 3 years that I've been in AIDE, the experience that I've had as a dancer has been nothing short of fun &amp; full of excitement. AIDE has taught me the importance of discipline, perseverance and teamwork through the preparation for various performances. Mostly, it is the friends I have made and come to know in AIDE that have made it all more meaningful.</em>

<p><em>As an active member of AIDE from 2021 to 2023, the journey in which we progress from online to physical training has mould me to be an adaptable dancer. In my serving years at AI, I continue to strive higher as I make more friends and seniors, where their guidance have brought me closer to achieving what I feel is the key achievement to a dancer; discipline and expression. I am more aware of my strengths which has led me to achieving my current position as Captain of AIDE. In a nutshell, the care and inclusivity that we have in AIDE community has created a second family in us. Being a part of AIDE has made me grow not only in terms of the physical strengths of a dancer but also as a resilient, discipline and great team player and discipline.</em>

<p><em>“Great dancers are not great because of their technique, they are great because of their passion.”</em>
</p>
<p><strong>- Martha Graham</strong>
</p>
<p>In the rhythmic heart of Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School, Dance Ensemble
has been a vibrant and energetic presence. With each step, twirl and beat
drop, our talented dancers have brought the magic of dance to our school
community.</p>
<p>This year, the Dance Ensemble performed in the annual Achievement Day
and cultural events. Our dance routines were nothing short of mesmerizing,
and the dedication and passion of our dancers shone brightly on stage.</p>
<p>Behind every spectacular performance lay hours of hard work and dedication.
Our dancers pushed their limits and honed their techniques, all under the
guidance of our talented instructors.</p>
<p>Yet, the most commendable aspect of AIDE lies in its inclusivity. Dancers
from diverse backgrounds come together in the spirit of dance. We strongly
believe in the sense of belonging and friendship, where we support each
other both on and off the dance floor.</p>
