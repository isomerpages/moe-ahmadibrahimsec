<h2>English Drama</h2>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>English Drama has been driven by its passion-filled members, passing down
a zest that has cultivated into raw commitment that is observed in all
of our training programmes. In English Drama, every student gets a chance
to shine on stage. English Drama not only focuses on theatrical and public
speaking skills but also students’ character development and passion for
drama. Students will also be pushed out of their comfort zone to achieve
their full potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The English Drama has made me into an individual who is definitely more confident and responsible. Not only that, the English Drama members have proven to be a family to me. I’m able to voice out my fears and weaknesses, with the guidance and comfort from the members and teachers. Being on stage, with the audience expecting something big and amazing from you makes me feel special. Overall, my experience in English Drama has been an awesome ride and one that I would never forget.</em>

<p>Clad in all black, our English Drama members look like soldiers ready
for battle. With fiery spirit in their hearts and props in tow, our members
‘charge’ towards their fort – the stage at Republic Polytechnic’s Cultural
Centre. Alas, after endless gruelling rehearsals, the ODDS members, are
ready to ‘break their legs’ at this year’s Human Values Drama Competition
(HVDF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few days later, John Kenneth Layba Agpaoa, of 3E4, is nominated for
the Best Actor Award!</p>
<p>In theatre and drama, the process is always more valuable than the end
product. As our ODDS members enter in and out of imagined battles in their
theatrical journey, we are confident they will emerge to be exploratory
and reflective members of the society, who have great socio-cultural awareness
and sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can’t agree more with Robert Redford who said that the arts ‘is a healing
force’.</p>

<p>English Drama participated in the Singapore Youth Festival. Owing to the
members’ hard work and commitment, the team was awarded with Certificate
of Distinction for 2013, 2015 and 2017. In 2014, ODDS made it into The
Straits’ Times as two of our members bagged home both the Best Actor and
Best Actress Awards for Human Value Drama Competition. The story was about
an autistic boy and his family’s struggles received special mention in
the news. In the same year, members performed a musical in the school’s
End-of Year concert, Palette of Sensation, which amazed the audience. At
the end of 2015, members participated in Fairytales’ Trail which took place
in various National Libraries around Singapore. Members continue to wow
the audience in 2016 with a performance for the school’s End-Of-Year concert,
Rhapsodies of Youth.</p>
