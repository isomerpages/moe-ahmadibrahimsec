<p><em>"Playing and competing in football made me realise the importance of teamwork and care for each other. We became more courageous when trying new skills and through winning, we display the value of excellence. It has been an amazing experience for me these three years with the great memories, sweat and tears training and playing with the team."<br /></em></p>
