<p>Green Service Club began as Leo Club, which was a CCA that develops youth leaders to provide service to the community. The transformation into a new CCA stems from the school&rsquo;s commitment towards providing Outdoor Learning Experiences (OLE) with heightened awareness about the environment and green efforts. Through this new CCA, Green Service Club, we aim to learn more, do more and also lead others to make contributions to the environment and the community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>"I was selected for the WWF Leadership programme. This training taught me to put myself out of my comfort zone, to lead others confidently in nature trails, and to improvise on my work. In preparation as a nature trail guide for the Festival of Biodiversity, my team and I spent months preparing the materials and rehearsing our presentation.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going through the exhibitions and activities, I realised that Singapore has very rich biodiversity despite its small size, and that we should do our best to conserve the wildlife here. Also, while designing the AI Green Trail, I learnt that we do interact with nature on a daily basis, sometimes without realising it and appreciating it enough."</em></p>
