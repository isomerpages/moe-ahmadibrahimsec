<h4><strong>Letter to Parents on Arrangement of schools after Circuit Breaker (22 May 2020)</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020, in a careful and safe manner.</p>
<p>From 2 June 2020, our graduating students and students who need additional support will return to school daily. The other levels will rotate weekly between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons. The school will ensure that safe management measures are in place to keep our students safe. Click&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/Letter%20to%20Parents%20on%20Arrangement%20of%20schools%20after%20Circuit%20Breaker.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>for more details on the measures and arrangements.</p>
<p>Our teachers will continue to monitor the progress of your child and be in regular contact with you and your child to provide support during this transition. MOE will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. We urge you to rely on official sources of information and not to circulate any unconfirmed information. You may also refer to MOE&rsquo;s Press Release here.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/arrangements-for-schools-and-institutes-of-higher-learning-at-the-end-of-circuit-breaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/arrangements-for-schools-and-institutes-of-higher-learning-at-the-end-of-circuit-breaker</a></strong></p>
<p>Thank you and keep safe!</p>
<h4><strong>Back-to-School Transition Plan for Graduating Students</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents and Students of Sec 4 and 5,</p>
<p>The school has scheduled the graduating cohort to return for lessons from 19 May to 29 May. These are focused on the following areas:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) O Level Mother Tongue Language (MTL), given the O Level Examination on 18 June; and<br />(b) Practical/Coursework sessions requiring the use of school facilities that were previously curtailed due to full Home-Based Learning in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached schedule that will stagger the start / end times across students groups to minimise inter-mingling. Do pay attention to the precautionary measures in force. These are to be strictly adhered to for the safety and well-being of all staff and students. We seek your understanding and cooperation on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, when school reopens for Term 3 on 2 June, the focus will be on helping students close learning gaps. The O Level MTL Prelim Exam will be held on 5 Jun (Fri), and there are no lessons for that day. In place of the Mid-Year Exam, timed trials will be conducted during lessons in Weeks 2 and 3 to provide feedback on student learning and readiness. Teachers will inform students of the schedule when they are back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The May holidays provide a meaningful time to recharge and revise. Please stay safe and we look forward to seeing the students soon.</p>

<h4><strong>Announcement for Sec 2E1 &amp; 2E4 Parents / Guardians</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents / Guardians of students from 2E1 and 2E4,</p>
<p>Ministry of Education has made announcement for Home-Based Learning (HBL) to take place in secondary schools on Thursdays. As such, your child/ward&rsquo;s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) lessons are affected. This year, Secondary 2 students are learning to present arguments in the form of docu-drama. Through this programme, we aim to have them hone research, argumentation, presentation and storytelling skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students are currently at the filming stage. 2 April was actually planned as the final day of filming for your child/ward&rsquo;s class. The filming requires students to utilise the school&rsquo;s iPads. As the HBL implementation affects 2E1 and 2E4&rsquo;s lessons, we have arranged for a make-up session&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>2E1 on&nbsp;<strong>Friday, 3 April 2020 from 1pm &ndash; 2.15pm</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>2E4 on&nbsp;<strong>Monday, 6 April 2020 from 3pm &ndash; 4pm.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Proper measures will be taken to ensure students&rsquo; safety. We hope to seek your understanding and co-operation in this matter.<br />Thank you.</p>
<h4><strong>Parent Resource Kit for HBL</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents / Guardians,</p>
<p>From 1 Apr 2020, schools will progressively transit to a blended learning model, starting with one day of Home-Based Learning (HBL) a week. Our students are familiar with HBL, as our school conducts it two times a year.</p>
<p>This issue of Parent Kit provides tips on how you can support your child&rsquo;s HBL and addresses some of your concerns. Join MOE&rsquo;s Facebook Live Session, &ldquo;Ask Me Anything About&hellip; Home-Based Learning&rdquo; on 1 April 2020, 8pm, to learn more about what HBL really means and the role you can play in your child&rsquo;s HBL.</p>

<h4><strong>Social Responsibility in Safeguarding the Well-being of our School Community</strong></h4>
<p><strong>23 Mar 2020<br /></strong>Dear Parents/ Guardians,</p>
<p>1. As Term 2 commences, we are mindful of the rapidly developing COVID-19 situation and we have stepped up measures in school to keep your child/ward safe. The additional precautionary measures in our school include:<br />a. Students and staff who have travelled overseas during the March holidays will not report to school for 14 days upon their arrival to Singapore.<br />b. CCAs and school-based after-school programmes will be suspended until 5 Apr 2020.<br />c. Students will adopt an assigned fixed seating arrangement in classrooms and in the canteen.<br />d. Students will carry out a daily wipe-down routine for spaces that they have used.</p>
<p>2. To further safe-guard our school community, we seek your assistance in the following:<br />a. If any household member(s) has returned from overseas within the past 14 days and develops a fever or starts to display flu-like symptoms, please ensure that he/she gets necessary medical attention as soon as possible.<br />While waiting for the outcome of medical diagnosis, we seek your understanding and cooperation in informing us immediately and keeping your child/ward at home. Please be assured that the school will minimise disruption to your child's learning by making arrangements for Home-Based Learning.<br />b. Please remind your child to exercise good personal hygiene practices, social responsibility and safe distancing measures even when they are not school. Students are strongly encouraged to avoid crowded places, gatherings and situations of prolonged mixing that could increase the risk of inter-class or inter-school transmission.</p>
<p>3. We all play an important part in times of crisis. Your vigilance and assistance will help us to keep our school as a safe place for learning for all. Together, we can get through this.</p>
<p>Ms Tan Ke-Xin<br />Principal</p>
<h4><strong>Additional Precautionary Measures in Term 2</strong></h4>
<p><strong>22 March 2020<br /></strong>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>1. In light of the evolving worldwide COVID-19 situation and the rise in imported cases into Singapore recently, we will be implementing additional ring-fencing measures to ensure our schools remain safe environments for learning.</p>
<p>2. All staff and students who have travelled and returned to Singapore on or after 14 March are placed on a 14-day Leave of Absence or Stay-Home Notice. The school has been checking in on their well-being on a daily basis and will continue to do so till they return to school. During this time, we seek your cooperation to ensure they stay home to avoid exposure and are then able to return to school as scheduled.</p>
<p>3. Daily temperature taking and visual screening will continue into Term 2. Visitors who have travelled in the past 14 days will also be denied entry to the school.</p>
<p>4. Further social distancing measures are being undertaken as school reopens.<br />a. Fixed exam-style seating arrangements will be put in place for all lessons to increase social distancing and facilitate contact tracing should the need arise.<br />b. Staggered recesses will see classes take turns to go for their break, spending the other half of their recess break in class. Play areas during recess have also been allocated to reduce inter-mingling among students.<br />c. CCA and all after-school activities are suspended for the first two weeks of Term&nbsp;2. This includes FSP and supplementary lessons. (Note: SBB lessons in the afternoon are part of the main curriculum and will continue.)<br />d. In addition to the suspension of external activities such as Learning Journeys and mass assembly programmes, all lessons conducted outside of the school are&nbsp;also suspended for the first two weeks of Term 2.<br />e. Students are to return home immediately after school to minimise inter-mingling.</p>
<p>5. A wipe-down routine is in place for students to clean the area they have used, both in classrooms and in the canteen. Please have your child/ward bring tissue paper. The school will be providing diluted liquid soap.</p>
<p>6. It is important that your child/ward continues to practise good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility. If unwell, students should see a doctor and observe the full duration of MC issued. Your child/ward should return to school only if they are well.</p>
<p>7. We seek your cooperation to stress upon your child/ward that it is critical that each one plays his/her part to ensure that the school remains a safe and healthy learning environment for all staff and students. Thank you.</p>
<p>Ms Tan Ke-Xin<br />Principal</p>
<h4><strong>RESCHEDULING OF KEY SCHOOL EVENTS</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>In view of the Covid-19 situation, the school will be rescheduling the following large-scale school events to avoid activities and preparations that involve large groups of students during this period.</p>

<p><strong><u>Change in Timetable for 8 April 2020</u></strong></p>
<p>In addition, the school will be replacing the timetable for 8 April (Wed) between 8.50am and 1.30pm with the Friday timetable from 7.50am to 12.30pm. Flag raising will still be at 8.30am on 8 April and CCE will take place from 1.30pm to 2.30pm. Students who take HCL will have their lesson from 2.30pm to 3.10pm.</p>
<p>This adjustment will allow a more balanced coverage of lessons due to a significant number of Fridays being affected by holidays and events.</p>
<p><strong><u>Observing 5-day MC Regime</u></strong></p>
<p>MOH has last week given guidance to doctors to provide Medical Certificates (MC) of five days for patients with respiratory symptoms so that they can stay home and recover. Many local confirmed cases had continued to &ldquo;circulate in the community&rdquo; or gone to work when they were already ill.</p>
<p>Thus, if a child is unwell, he/she should see the doctor promptly, and should remain at home until he/she recovers fully. The same advisory will be issued to all staff.</p>
<p>To ensure the school remains a safe and healthy learning environment for all our staff and students, we seek your continued partnership to ensure our students/children practise good personal hygiene and exercise social responsibility.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<h4><strong>COMMON TEST FOR SEC 2 AND SEC 4</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>Common Test for Sec 2 and Sec 4 classes begin tomorrow, 13 Feb.</p>
<p>While this represents an important assessment milestone, we seek your understanding to ensure your child/ward is well during this period when attending school. If unwell, he/she should stay away from school and see a doctor to obtain a medical certificate. Your child/ward should return only when well.</p>
<p>Should your child/ward require an extended period beyond the MC duration to recover fully, the school will accept a Parent's Letter in lieu of a second MC to excuse him/her from the paper.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued partnership to ensure the school remains a safe and healthy learning environment for all staff and students.</p>
<h4><strong>ENHANCED SCHOOL MEASURES FOR NOVEL CORONAVIRUS</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians</p>
<p>As school re-opens on 29 Jan 2020, MOE will be enhancing precautionary measures, including daily temperature taking, to ensure that our schools remain a safe and healthy learning environment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Please ensure your child brings an Oral Digital Thermometer to school from 29 Jan onwards.</u></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While teachers actively look out for students&rsquo; well-being, please ensure your child practises good personal hygiene and social responsibility. You should take your child to the doctor if he/she is unwell and we would appreciate it that you keep your child at home until he/she recovers.</p>
<p>If your child has returned&nbsp;<u>from mainland China</u>&nbsp;on 15 Jan or later, he/she will be placed on Leave of Absence (LOA) for a period&nbsp;<u>of 14 days</u>, starting from the first day after return. For example, if your child returns to Singapore&nbsp;<u>on 28 Jan</u>&nbsp;(Tue), the LOA would last from&nbsp;<u>29 Jan to 11 Feb</u>, with the date of return to school being&nbsp;<u>12 Feb</u>&nbsp;(Wed).</p>
<img src="/images/20_1.jpg">
<p>Students on LOA will be supported by home-based learning assigned by the school. If you have any queries on LOA, you can call the school office at 6758 5384.</p>
<p>For updates on the coronavirus situation, you can visit&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moh.gov.sg</a></strong>&nbsp;or sign up at&nbsp;<strong><u><a href="http://go.gov.sg/whatsapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go.gov.sg/whatsapp</a></u></strong>&nbsp;to receive the latest information via Whatsapp. We will keep you updated on school measures and education related notifications.</p>
