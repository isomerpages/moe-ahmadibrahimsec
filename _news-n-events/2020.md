<h4><strong>Letter to Parents on Arrangement of schools after Circuit Breaker (22 May 2020)</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020, in a careful and safe manner.</p>
<p>From 2 June 2020, our graduating students and students who need additional support will return to school daily. The other levels will rotate weekly between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons. The school will ensure that safe management measures are in place to keep our students safe. Click&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/Letter%20to%20Parents%20on%20Arrangement%20of%20schools%20after%20Circuit%20Breaker.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>for more details on the measures and arrangements.</p>
<p>Our teachers will continue to monitor the progress of your child and be in regular contact with you and your child to provide support during this transition. MOE will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. We urge you to rely on official sources of information and not to circulate any unconfirmed information. You may also refer to MOE&rsquo;s Press Release here.</p>
