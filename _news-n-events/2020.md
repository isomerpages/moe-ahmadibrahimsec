<h4><strong>Letter to Parents on Arrangement of schools after Circuit Breaker (22 May 2020)</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>With the end of the Circuit Breaker period on 1 June 2020, we will progressively bring students back to school from 2 June 2020, in a careful and safe manner.</p>
<p>From 2 June 2020, our graduating students and students who need additional support will return to school daily. The other levels will rotate weekly between Home-Based Learning (HBL) and returning to school for lessons. The school will ensure that safe management measures are in place to keep our students safe. Click&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/Letter%20to%20Parents%20on%20Arrangement%20of%20schools%20after%20Circuit%20Breaker.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>&nbsp;</strong>for more details on the measures and arrangements.</p>
<p>Our teachers will continue to monitor the progress of your child and be in regular contact with you and your child to provide support during this transition. MOE will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. We urge you to rely on official sources of information and not to circulate any unconfirmed information. You may also refer to MOE&rsquo;s Press Release here.</p>

<p>Thank you and keep safe!</p>
<h4><strong>Back-to-School Transition Plan for Graduating Students</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents and Students of Sec 4 and 5,</p>
<p>The school has scheduled the graduating cohort to return for lessons from 19 May to 29 May. These are focused on the following areas:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) O Level Mother Tongue Language (MTL), given the O Level Examination on 18 June; and<br />(b) Practical/Coursework sessions requiring the use of school facilities that were previously curtailed due to full Home-Based Learning in April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the attached schedule that will stagger the start / end times across students groups to minimise inter-mingling. Do pay attention to the precautionary measures in force. These are to be strictly adhered to for the safety and well-being of all staff and students. We seek your understanding and cooperation on the matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, when school reopens for Term 3 on 2 June, the focus will be on helping students close learning gaps. The O Level MTL Prelim Exam will be held on 5 Jun (Fri), and there are no lessons for that day. In place of the Mid-Year Exam, timed trials will be conducted during lessons in Weeks 2 and 3 to provide feedback on student learning and readiness. Teachers will inform students of the schedule when they are back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The May holidays provide a meaningful time to recharge and revise. Please stay safe and we look forward to seeing the students soon.</p>
