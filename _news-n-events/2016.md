	<p>Report featured Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS), which had been taking in visually impaired (VI) students since the 1960s. Following feedback from its VI students, the school hired a special coach in August 2014, to train them in PE. Report carried the following comments from AISS staff and students</p>
<ul>
<li>VI resource teacher Penny Chong said partially-sighted students could take part in PE with their classmates if they were confident enough, but this was not encouraged for those who were totally blind, as it was difficult for the teacher to keep an eye on the VI student in a class of 40.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Student Dallon Au, who was partially-sighted with congenital cataract, shared that going for a run helped him solve a math question which he could not earlier.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Student Neo Kar Wee, who was partially-sighted with glaucoma, was excited when the school hired the special coach. <em><strong><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-to-be-done-to/2847426.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(read more...)</a></strong></em></li>

	<p><strong>AISS's EMP &amp; MPC Students Featured in Singapore Rhapsodies at the National Gallery Singapore</strong></p>
	<p>On 29th January 2016, our students from the pioneer batches of the Enhanced Music Programme and Music Preparatory Course performed at the launch event for Singapore Rhapsodies, a concert series at the National Gallery Singapore that seeks to preserve and celebrate Singapore&rsquo;s rich music heritage.</p>
<p>Adelyn Koh (Sec 3), Koh Ming Yang (Sec 1) and Jessie Phay (Sec 1) performed on the iconic red Steinway piano at the National Gallery&rsquo;s Singapore Courtyard. Adelyn, who performed her original composition titled &ldquo;Friendship&rdquo;, was interviewed by The Straits Times. She said that it was great to be able to perform on the red Steinway piano, and it sounded much grander than the pianos she rehearsed on.</p>
