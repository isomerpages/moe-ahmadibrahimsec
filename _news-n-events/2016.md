<p>Report featured Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS), which had been
taking in visually impaired (VI) students since the 1960s. Following feedback
from its VI students, the school hired a special coach in August 2014,
to train them in PE. Report carried the following comments from AISS staff
and students</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>VI resource teacher Penny Chong said partially-sighted students could
take part in PE with their classmates if they were confident enough, but
this was not encouraged for those who were totally blind, as it was difficult
for the teacher to keep an eye on the VI student in a class of 40.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>Student Dallon Au, who was partially-sighted with congenital cataract,
shared that going for a run helped him solve a math question which he could
not earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>Student Neo Kar Wee, who was partially-sighted with glaucoma, was excited
when the school hired the special coach.</p>

<p><strong>AISS's EMP &amp; MPC Students Featured in Singapore Rhapsodies at the National Gallery Singapore</strong>
<br>On 29th January 2016, our students from the pioneer batches of the Enhanced
Music Programme and Music Preparatory Course performed at the launch event
for Singapore Rhapsodies, a concert series at the National Gallery Singapore
that seeks to preserve and celebrate Singapore’s rich music heritage.</p>
<p>Adelyn Koh (Sec 3), Koh Ming Yang (Sec 1) and Jessie Phay (Sec 1) performed
on the iconic red Steinway piano at the National Gallery’s Singapore Courtyard.
Adelyn, who performed her original composition titled “Friendship”, was
interviewed by The Straits Times. She said that it was great to be able
to perform on the red Steinway piano, and it sounded much grander than
the pianos she rehearsed on.</p>

<p>Channel NewsAsia featured national shooter Jasmine Ser and traced the
history of the shooting sport at Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School (AISS).
Ser shared that AISS had a long track record of achievements, leading to
an inevitable pressure on the student athletes to continue the school’s
legacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Charles Cheak, Subject head of CCA/AISS, said there was a talent identification
programme for all Secondary 1 students and they go through suitability
assessments, where they get to try out all sports in order to determine
their suitability for each of them.</p>
<p>Mr Yao Zi Jian, Assistant Year Head of Secondary 2/AISS, added that there
was a Shooting Appreciation Module during physical education lessons where
students could learn more about, and thus gain a deeper appreciation of,
the sport.&nbsp;</p>
