Ser shared that AISS had a long track record of achievements, leading to an inevitable pressure on the student athletes to continue the school&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<p>Mr Charles Cheak, Subject head of CCA/AISS, said there was a talent identification programme for all Secondary 1 students and they go through suitability assessments, where they get to try out all sports in order to determine their suitability for each of them.</p>
<p>Mr Yao Zi Jian, Assistant Year Head of Secondary 2/AISS, added that there was a Shooting Appreciation Module during physical education lessons where students could learn more about, and thus gain a deeper appreciation of, the sport.</p>
