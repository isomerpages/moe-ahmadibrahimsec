<p><strong>1) Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br /></strong>I have great memories from my AI days. Learning was always fun with my teachers and classmates. We are still very good friends after so many years.</p>
<p>I was from the Military band. It must have been the most memorable times in AI. We had over 100 new recruits the year i joined and we had a lot of fun learning how to play the instruments and practicing for all the marching parade and performances. I was appointed Band Major in 1990 and had the chance to lead the band. This experience helped me grew a lot and impacted my life in many ways.</p>

<p><strong>1) Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br /></strong>I remember my time in AI as experiencing the freedom of being supported and guided by good teachers and friends, and yet not be burdened by undue expectations or unrealistic goals. That gave me the confidence, and support, to find my life directions and priorities. Teachers and friends in AI were sincere and authentic, and it was easy to make and keep friends. In fact, I&rsquo;m still in touch with a few classmates, and we play soccer occasionally. We run less, at a slower pace, but we still chat as much whilst we&rsquo;re playing! AI provided the environment for lifelong friendships.</p>
<p><strong>2) Describe AI in one word<br /></strong>A few come to mind:</p>
<p>(a) Freedom &ndash; You chose your pace, your goals, your level of ambition. And the teachers would match that with corresponding support, and ambition! Not that they would permit any of us to be mediocre or slack, but they gave us lots of room to grow and mature.</p>
<p>(b) Sincerity &ndash; There was such a refreshing lack of airs and pretensions. People were comfortable being who they were, and who/how others were. There was an authenticity from the teachers, which encouraged us to be genuinely supportive of our peers.</p>
<p>(c) Selflessness &ndash; many teachers were extremely hardworking and giving. Whilst we strived and worked hard, were never became overly competitive nor selfish. There was always celebration for the achievement(s) and successes of our classmates. Even as I meet my AI classmates today, there is not a single hint of envy amongst us despite the differences in our vocation and material wealth - we&rsquo;re just glad to be together again.</p>
<p><strong>3) What did you do after AI?<br /></strong>I went on to Catholic Junior College, and then read Law at the National University of Singapore. My first jobs were in Law &ndash; as a legal officer and then as a law lecturer. Then, I switched to teaching at a university, which I&rsquo;m still doing after more than a decade. Needless to say, the exemplary teachers I encountered at AI inspired me (thanks Mr Kumar!), and I&rsquo;m just trying to pass on the values and live out the attributes I witnessed for myself in AI.</p>
<p><strong>4) What inspired you to go down this career path?<br /></strong>See above.</p>
<p><strong>5) Any advice for our students of today?<br /></strong>(a) Build lasting friendships &ndash; you&rsquo;ll want friends to still play with in your fifties!<br />(b) Learn from the best teachers &ndash; they exemplify the kind of life, vocation, and calling we all aspire to.<br />(c) Freedom is good only if there is also Friendship + Family &ndash; to support you through thick and thin in life, and desire the best for you. If you look hard enough, you can find it in your school!</p>
