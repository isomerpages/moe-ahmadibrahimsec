<p><strong>1) Your fondest memory of life in AI?<br /></strong>I have great memories from my AI days. Learning was always fun with my teachers and classmates. We are still very good friends after so many years.</p>
<p>I was from the Military band. It must have been the most memorable times in AI. We had over 100 new recruits the year i joined and we had a lot of fun learning how to play the instruments and practicing for all the marching parade and performances. I was appointed Band Major in 1990 and had the chance to lead the band. This experience helped me grew a lot and impacted my life in many ways.</p>
