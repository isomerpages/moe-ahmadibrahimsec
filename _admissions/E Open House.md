<p>Dear all!</p>
<p>Registration for our E-Open House is now open.</p>
<p>We are excited to invite you to our e-Open House on&nbsp;<strong>16th &amp; 23rd November 2024</strong>,
from&nbsp;<strong>9:00 to 11:30 AM</strong>. The sessions will be held
online via Zoom, and we would love for you to join us!</p>
<p>This will be a great opportunity to learn more about what AI can offer
our students as they embark on their secondary school journey. Weâ€™ll be
happy to share insights about our programs, values, and the overall student
experience at AI.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you!</p>
