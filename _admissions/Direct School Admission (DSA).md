<h3><strong>DSA-Sec Exercise 2024</strong></h3>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was first introduced in 2004 as part of MOE's move
towards a more flexible and broad-based education system. Under the DSA-Sec
Exercise, schools will be able to select a percentage of their students
for admission outside of the centralized posting system, via their own
selection criteria. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools
wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind
the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes
available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<p>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected
to honour their commitment to the school and participate in the activities
related to the talent which they are selected for Year 1 - 4.</p>
<p>
<br><strong><u>Talent Areas</u></strong>
<br>At Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School, we aim to nurture our students into
